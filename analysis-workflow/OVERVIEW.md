# TPB Future Analysis Overview

## Project Context
We are analyzing and planning the transformation of The Peak Beyond from legacy cannabis retail systems to a modern platform positioned for the AI agent economy. This analysis supports the strategic vision outlined in `../future-considerations/` documents.

## Strategic Goals
Based on future-considerations analysis, our transformation goals are:

1. **Stabilize V1 Systems** - Reduce support burden while building V2 foundation
2. **Build V2 Spine** - User accounts, enriched data, agent-ready APIs
3. **Dual Revenue Engines** - Affiliate feeds (outside cannabis) + Data SaaS (inside cannabis)
4. **Agent Economy Positioning** - Become the "vertical intelligence layer" for cannabis retail

## Analysis Tasks

### Task 1: V1 System Identification & Stabilization Planning
**Objective**: Identify current legacy systems that need rebuilding, modernization, and stabilization

**Scope**:
- Legacy repositories analysis (`../repositories/`)
- Technical debt assessment
- Stabilization strategy alignment with future-considerations
- Priority mapping for V1 fixes that seed V2

**Key Questions**:
- What are the current V1 systems and their stability issues?
- Which systems align with the "stabilize V1 to seed V2" strategy?
- What are the highest ROI stabilization activities?
- How do V1 fixes directly become V2 building blocks?

**Deliverables**:
- Legacy system inventory and assessment
- Stabilization roadmap with V2 alignment
- Technical debt prioritization matrix

### Task 2: E-commerce Architecture Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE to understand how it was built and if it uses the modern tech stack we want

**Scope**:
- Technical stack evaluation (React/TypeScript + NestJS)
- Architecture pattern analysis
- Code quality and maintainability assessment
- Alignment with future-considerations tech choices

**Key Questions**:
- What is the technical architecture of the e-commerce project?
- Does it use modern, maintainable technologies?
- How does it align with our V2 target architecture?
- What patterns and practices can we adopt?

**Deliverables**:
- Technical architecture documentation
- Stack alignment assessment
- Pattern and practice recommendations

### Task 3: E-commerce Usability Analysis
**Objective**: Determine what from TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE is usable for accomplishing future-considerations goals

**Scope**:
- Feature completeness evaluation
- Component reusability assessment
- API design pattern analysis
- State management strategy review

**Key Questions**:
- What features and components can be reused?
- How do the APIs align with our agent-ready requirements?
- What authentication/authorization patterns exist?
- What data models and schemas are defined?

**Deliverables**:
- Feature inventory and gap analysis
- Reusability assessment matrix
- API pattern evaluation

### Task 4: Portability & Integration Planning
**Objective**: Analyze what is portable from e-commerce project and plan the best way to accomplish future goals

**Scope**:
- Code porting strategy
- Integration approach planning
- Migration path definition
- Resource requirement estimation

**Key Questions**:
- What code can be directly ported vs. adapted?
- How do we integrate e-commerce patterns with V1 systems?
- What is the migration strategy for V2 development?
- How do we maintain development velocity during transition?

**Deliverables**:
- Portability strategy and recommendations
- Integration approach planning
- Migration roadmap with resource requirements

## Methodology

### Analysis Approach
1. **Systematic Documentation** - Follow structured templates and standards
2. **Cross-Reference Validation** - Ensure alignment with future-considerations goals
3. **Technical Deep-Dive** - Code-level analysis with architectural understanding
4. **Strategic Alignment** - Connect technical findings to business objectives
5. **Actionable Recommendations** - Provide clear next steps with priorities

### Documentation Strategy
- **Structured Analysis** - Use consistent templates and formats
- **Visual Documentation** - Include diagrams and architectural representations
- **Traceability** - Link findings back to strategic goals and requirements
- **Version Control** - Track analysis evolution and decision rationale

### Quality Assurance
- **Peer Review** - All analysis documents reviewed for completeness
- **Cross-Validation** - Findings validated against multiple sources
- **Strategic Alignment** - Recommendations aligned with future-considerations
- **Implementation Readiness** - Deliverables support immediate action
