# Estimation Plan

## Complexity Tiers â†’ Hours (initial)
- S: 4-8h
- M: 12-24h
- L: 32-64h
- XL: 80-120h

Notes:
- Consolidate overlapping work (e.g., page + component rewrites) to avoid double counting.
- Provider-specific checkout screens will be unified behind adapters.
- Home layouts consolidated into a configurable layout system.

## Next Step
- Assign hour ranges per item using tiers above and consolidate totals by domain (pages, components, state, API, mixins).
