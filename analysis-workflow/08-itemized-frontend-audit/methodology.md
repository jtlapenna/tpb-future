# Methodology

- Extract from code: router pages, components, store modules, API clients, mixins, plugins.
- Cross-check with knowledge bases for completeness.
- Classify each item: type, location, size/complexity, dependencies, issues.
- Mark modernization actions: replace, port, refactor, delete.
- Quantify effort using complexity tiers (S/M/L/XL).
