## Conclusion

The user accounts implementation in the TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE project is approximately **39% complete** when measured against modern standards and V2 requirements. While it provides a solid foundation with AWS Amplify integration and basic authentication features, it requires significant modernization and completion work.

The **recommended approach** is to modernize the existing implementation rather than rebuild from scratch, as this preserves valuable patterns and reduces development time by 40-50%. The focus should be on security hardening, framework updates, and feature completion to achieve a production-ready user accounts system that aligns with V2 goals.
