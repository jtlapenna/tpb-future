## Executive Summary

This comprehensive summary synthesizes the deep dive analyses of the three most critical fragile systems in The Peak Beyond's V1 architecture: Frontend (Vue.js), API/Backend (Rails), and POS Sync. The analysis reveals a complex ecosystem built on end-of-life technologies with significant technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and maintenance challenges. However, each system also presents substantial opportunities for modernization that will directly seed V2 development goals.

## Key Findings Overview

### System Fragility Assessment
