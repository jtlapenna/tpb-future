## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: V1 System Analysis (01-v1-analysis/)
**Objective**: Identify current legacy systems requiring stabilization and modernization
- **Tasks**:
  - Inventory legacy repositories and their current state
  - Assess technical debt and stability issues
  - Map dependencies and integration points
  - Identify stabilization priorities per future-considerations strategy
- **Deliverables**:
  - Legacy system inventory
  - Technical debt assessment
  - Stabilization roadmap aligned with V2 goals

### Phase 2: E-commerce Analysis (02-ecomm-analysis/)
**Objective**: Analyze TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE to understand its architecture and capabilities
- **Tasks**:
  - Technical stack analysis (React/TypeScript + NestJS)
  - Architecture pattern assessment
  - Feature completeness evaluation
  - Code quality and maintainability review
- **Deliverables**:
  - Technical architecture documentation
  - Feature inventory and gap analysis
  - Code quality assessment

### Phase 3: Portability Analysis (03-portability-analysis/)
**Objective**: Determine what can be reused/ported from e-commerce project for V2 goals
- **Tasks**:
  - Component reusability assessment
  - API design pattern evaluation
  - State management strategy analysis
  - Authentication/authorization pattern review
- **Deliverables**:
  - Reusability matrix
  - Porting strategy recommendations
  - Integration approach planning

### Phase 4: Implementation Planning (04-implementation-planning/)
**Objective**: Create detailed implementation plans for V2 development
- **Tasks**:
  - Cross-reference analysis findings with future-considerations goals
  - Create technical implementation roadmap
  - Define migration strategies
  - Plan resource allocation and timelines
- **Deliverables**:
  - Implementation roadmap
  - Migration strategies
  - Resource planning documents

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- `YYYY-MM-DD_task-name.md` for dated analysis files
- `template_[type].md` for reusable templates
- `summary_[phase].md` for phase summaries
- `recommendations_[area].md` for final recommendations

### Document Structure
Each analysis document should follow this structure:
1. **Executive Summary** - Key findings and recommendations
2. **Analysis Scope** - What was analyzed and why
3. **Methodology** - How the analysis was conducted
4. **Findings** - Detailed analysis results
5. **Recommendations** - Actionable next steps
6. **Dependencies** - What this analysis depends on
7. **Next Steps** - Immediate follow-up actions

### Cross-References
- Link to relevant future-considerations documents
- Reference specific code files and line numbers
- Include diagrams and visual representations
- Maintain traceability to original requirements
