# Professional Legacy Modernization Workflow

## Overview
This folder contains a systematic, professional approach to modernizing the TPB legacy Vue.js application to a modern React/Next.js tech stack. This follows industry best practices used by expert development teams.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Audit & Analysis
- **01-component-inventory/**: Complete Vue component catalog with props, events, dependencies
- **02-state-management-audit/**: Vuex stores, data flow, mutations, actions analysis
- **03-api-integration-audit/**: API calls, data contracts, error handling documentation
- **04-styling-system-analysis/**: SCSS variables, mixins, responsive breakpoints, design tokens
- **05-business-logic-extraction/**: Reusable business rules and utilities identification
- **06-dependency-mapping/**: External libraries and modern equivalents mapping

### Phase 2: Architecture Design
- **07-modern-architecture/**: React/Next.js patterns, component hierarchy, data flow
- **08-api-strategy/**: Data fetching, caching, error boundaries strategy
- **09-styling-strategy/**: CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, or SCSS modules approach
- **10-testing-strategy/**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing approach

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning
- **11-migration-strategy/**: Incremental migration, micro-frontends, feature flags
- **12-risk-mitigation/**: Rollback plans, A/B testing, gradual rollout
- **13-team-structure/**: Roles, responsibilities, parallel development streams
- **14-timeline-milestones/**: Realistic estimates with buffer time

## Methodology
Each phase builds upon the previous, ensuring no critical information is missed and the modernization is based on solid understanding of the existing system.

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of legacy system architecture
- Clear mapping to modern tech stack patterns
- Detailed implementation plan with risk mitigation
- Realistic timeline and resource estimates
