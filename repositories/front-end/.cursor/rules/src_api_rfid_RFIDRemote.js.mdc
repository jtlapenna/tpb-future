# RFIDRemote.js Documentation

## Overview
The `RFIDRemote` class is responsible for handling API requests related to RFID data. It provides a method to retrieve a list of RFID entries from the server using HTTP GET requests.

## Key Components
### RFIDRemote Class
- **index()**: This method sends a GET request to the endpoint `rfids` to fetch all RFID records. It utilizes the `HTTP` module to perform the request.

## Dependencies
- **src/api/http.js**: This file is imported to handle HTTP requests. It abstracts the details of making HTTP calls, allowing the `RFIDRemote` class to focus on the specific API endpoints.

### Imported By
- **src/api/rfid/RFIDRepo.js**: This file imports `RFIDRemote` to utilize its methods for fetching RFID data, indicating that `RFIDRepo` likely serves as a repository layer for managing RFID data operations.

## Usage Example
To use the `RFIDRemote` class, you can create an instance and call the `index` method:
```javascript
import { RFIDRemote } from './RFIDRemote';

const rfidRemote = new RFIDRemote();

rfidRemote.index().then(response => {
  console.log('RFID Data:', response);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error fetching RFID data:', error);
});
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `HTTP` module is properly configured to handle errors and responses effectively.
- Consider implementing additional methods in `RFIDRemote` for other CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) related to RFID data.
- Keep the API endpoints consistent and well-documented to facilitate easier integration and maintenance.
