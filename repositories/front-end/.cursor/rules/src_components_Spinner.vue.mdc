# Spinner Component Documentation

## Overview
The `Spinner.vue` file defines a reusable spinner component for loading indicators in a Vue.js application. It provides a visual cue to users that a process is ongoing, enhancing user experience during asynchronous operations.

## Key Components
- **Template**: The template section contains a `div` element styled as a spinner. It uses Vue's `v-bind` directive to bind any additional attributes passed to the component.
- **Props**:
  - `width`: Controls the width of the spinner. It accepts both string and number types, with a default value of `48` pixels.
  - `thiccness`: Controls the thickness of the spinner's border. It also accepts string and number types, with a default value of `4` pixels.
- **Styles**: The CSS styles define the appearance of the spinner, including its size, border, and animation. The spinner is styled to be circular and animated to rotate continuously.
- **Animation**: The `@keyframes spin` defines the rotation animation, which rotates the spinner from `0deg` to `360deg` in a linear fashion.

## Dependencies
This component does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It is a standalone component that can be used wherever a loading indicator is needed.

## Usage Example
To use the `Spinner` component in another Vue component, you can import it and include it in your template as follows:
```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <Spinner :width="60" :thiccness="5" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import Spinner from './components/Spinner.vue';

export default {
  components: {
    Spinner
  }
};
</script>
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the spinner is used in contexts where loading times are expected, such as during data fetching or processing.
- Customize the `width` and `thiccness` props to match the design requirements of your application.
- Avoid using multiple spinners simultaneously to prevent UI clutter and confusion for users.
