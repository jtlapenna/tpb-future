# SCSS Animations Documentation

  - **80%**: Element reaches full scale (1) but fades out to opacity 0.
  - **100%**: Element returns to scale 0 and opacity 0.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone as a utility for animations.

## Usage Examples
To use these animations, you can apply them to any HTML element using the `animation` property in your SCSS or CSS files. For example:
```scss
.element {
  animation: wave-pulse 2s infinite;
}
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that animations are used sparingly to avoid overwhelming users.
- Consider performance implications when applying multiple animations to elements.
- Use the `animation-fill-mode` property to control how the animation behaves before and after execution.
- Test animations across different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.
