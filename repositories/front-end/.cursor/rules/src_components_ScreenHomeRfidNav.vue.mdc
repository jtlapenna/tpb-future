The `ScreenHomeRfidNav` component is a Vue.js component designed for the home screen of an RFID navigation system. It provides a visual interface that includes a store logo, instructional animations, and navigation elements. The component is structured to handle transitions and animations effectively, enhancing user experience.

## Key Components

  - `storeLogo`: Holds the URL of the store logo.
  - `storeLogoRatio`: Determines the aspect ratio of the store logo based on its dimensions.
  - `transitionReady`: A counter to manage transition readiness.
- **Props**:
  - `isActiveCartFeatureActivated`: A boolean prop that controls the visibility of the active cart button.
- **Methods**:
  - `transitionEnter()`: Handles the entrance animation of the component, utilizing GSAP for smooth transitions.
  - `onTransitionLeave()`: Manages the exit animation when the component is removed from the DOM.
  - `logoHold()` and `logoRelease()`: Emit events to manage hard refresh actions when the logo is held or released.
