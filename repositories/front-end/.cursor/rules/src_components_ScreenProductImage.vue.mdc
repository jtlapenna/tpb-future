# ScreenProductImage.vue Documentation

## Overview
The `ScreenProductImage` component is a Vue.js single-file component designed to display a full-screen image. It utilizes Vue's reactivity to manage the image source and provides a fade-out animation effect when triggered. This component is particularly useful for showcasing product images in a visually appealing manner.

## Key Components
- **Template**: The template consists of a `div` containing an `img` element that displays the image if the `imageSrc` prop is provided.
- **Props**:  
  - `imageSrc`: A required string prop that specifies the source URL of the image to be displayed.
- **Methods**:  
  - `startAnimatingOut()`: This method adds a `fade-out` class to the image, triggering a CSS transition that fades the image out.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**:  
  - `created()`: Registers an event listener for `animate-full-screen-background` to trigger the fade-out animation.
  - `beforeDestroy()`: Cleans up the event listener to prevent memory leaks.

## Dependencies
This component does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It operates independently, relying solely on its props and internal methods.

## Usage Example
To use the `ScreenProductImage` component, you can include it in a parent component as follows:
```vue
<template>
  <ScreenProductImage imageSrc="path/to/image.jpg" />
</template>
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `imageSrc` prop is always provided to avoid rendering issues.
- Use the component in contexts where a full-screen image display is appropriate, such as product showcases or galleries.
- Clean up any event listeners in the `beforeDestroy` lifecycle hook to maintain performance and prevent memory leaks.
- Consider adding additional props for customization, such as animation duration or image alt text for accessibility.
