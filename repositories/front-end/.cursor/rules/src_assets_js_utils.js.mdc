# Overview

The `utils.js` file is a utility module that enhances jQuery's functionality by adding a custom method to its prototype. Specifically, it adds a `reverse` method that allows for reversing arrays directly through jQuery's object.

# Key Components

- **jQuery.fn.reverse**: This line assigns the native JavaScript `reverse` method of arrays to jQuery's prototype. This allows any jQuery object that contains an array to call `.reverse()` directly.

# Dependencies

This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a utility enhancement for jQuery.

# Usage Example

After including this utility in your project, you can reverse an array of elements selected by jQuery as follows:

```javascript
const reversedArray = $("li").toArray().reverse();
```

This example selects all `<li>` elements, converts them to an array, and then reverses the order of the elements.

# Best Practices

- Ensure that jQuery is loaded before this utility file to avoid any errors.
- Use this utility method judiciously, as reversing large arrays can impact performance. Consider the size of the data being manipulated.
- Document any changes made to the jQuery prototype in your project to maintain clarity for other developers.
