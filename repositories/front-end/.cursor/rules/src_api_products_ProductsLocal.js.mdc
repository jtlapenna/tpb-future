# ProductsLocal.js Documentation

## Overview
The `ProductsLocal` class is a part of the local data management layer for products in the application. It extends the `LocalRepo` class, providing a specific implementation for handling product data stored locally.

## Key Components
- **ProductsLocal Class**: This class inherits from `LocalRepo`, which is a generic repository class designed to manage local data storage. The constructor of `ProductsLocal` initializes the repository with the name 'products' and the identifier 'id'.

### Constructor
```javascript
constructor () {
    super('products', 'id')
}
```
The constructor calls the parent class's constructor with specific parameters that define the context of this repository.

## Dependencies
- **LocalRepo**: This file imports the `LocalRepo` class from `../LocalRepo`. The `LocalRepo` class provides the foundational methods and properties for local data management, which `ProductsLocal` builds upon.

### Related Files
- **ProductsRepo.js**: This file imports `ProductsLocal`, indicating that it likely uses this class to interact with product data in a local context.

## Usage Example
To use the `ProductsLocal` class, you would typically instantiate it and call its methods to manage product data. For example:
```javascript
const productsLocal = new ProductsLocal();
// Use productsLocal to perform operations like add, remove, or fetch products.
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that any modifications to the product data are done through the `ProductsLocal` class to maintain data integrity.
- When extending or modifying the `LocalRepo`, be cautious of how changes may affect the `ProductsLocal` class and its functionality.
- Keep the naming conventions consistent to avoid confusion with other repository classes.
