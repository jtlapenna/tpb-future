# Configuration File Documentation

## Overview
The `config.js` file is a configuration module that exports a constant `SERVER_KEY`. This key is typically used for authentication or authorization purposes in server communications.

## Key Components
- **SERVER_KEY**: A constant string that holds the server key used for API requests. This key is crucial for ensuring secure communication between the client and the server.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone as a configuration file, meaning it does not rely on or affect other parts of the codebase directly.

## Usage Example
To use the `SERVER_KEY` in another part of your application, you can import it as follows:
```javascript
import { SERVER_KEY } from './functions/config';

console.log(SERVER_KEY); // Outputs the server key
```

## Best Practices
- **Security**: Ensure that the `SERVER_KEY` is kept secure and not exposed in client-side code. Consider using environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive information.
- **Version Control**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive keys directly in the codebase. Instead, use configuration management tools or environment variables to manage such keys securely.
- **Documentation**: Keep this documentation updated if the purpose or usage of the `SERVER_KEY` changes in the future.
