# BrandsRepo.js Documentation

## Overview
The `BrandsRepo` class serves as a repository for managing brand data within the application. It acts as an intermediary between the local and remote data sources, facilitating data retrieval and storage operations.

## Key Components
- **BrandsRepo Class**: Inherits from the `Repo` class, encapsulating the logic for interacting with both local and remote brand data sources.
  - **Constructor**: Initializes the `BrandsRepo` with instances of `BrandsRemote` and `BrandsLocal`, and sets the resource name to 'brands'.

## Dependencies
This file imports the following modules:
- `BrandsLocal`: Handles local storage and retrieval of brand data.
- `BrandsRemote`: Manages remote API calls for brand data.
- `Repo`: A base class that provides common repository functionalities.

The `BrandsRepo` class does not have any external dependencies, meaning it is not imported by any other files in the repository.

## Usage Example
To use the `BrandsRepo`, you can simply import it and call its methods to interact with brand data:
```javascript
import BrandsRepo from './BrandsRepo';

// Example usage
BrandsRepo.getAllBrands().then(brands => {
  console.log(brands);
});
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that both `BrandsLocal` and `BrandsRemote` are properly implemented to handle data consistency and error management.
- When extending the `BrandsRepo`, maintain the separation of concerns by keeping local and remote logic distinct.
- Regularly test the integration between local and remote data sources to ensure reliability in data handling.
