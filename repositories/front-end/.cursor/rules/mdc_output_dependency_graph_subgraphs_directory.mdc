# Dependency Graph Subgraphs

## Overview
The `dependency_graph_subgraphs` directory contains generated HTML files that represent subgraphs of dependencies within the codebase. This visualization aids developers in understanding the relationships and hierarchies between different components of the project.

## Key Files
- **index.html**: This is the main entry point for viewing the dependency subgraphs. It provides an interactive visualization of the dependencies, allowing users to explore the structure and connections between various modules.

## Relation to Other Parts of the Codebase
This directory is a part of the broader dependency analysis tools within the codebase. It does not import from or export to any other files, making it a standalone output directory. The data visualized in this directory is typically generated from analysis scripts that parse the codebase to identify dependencies.

## Common Patterns and Conventions
- The files in this directory are generated automatically and should not be manually edited. Any changes to the visualizations should be made in the scripts that generate these files.
- The naming convention for files is straightforward, with `index.html` serving as the primary file for access.

## Best Practices
- Always regenerate the files in this directory after making changes to the dependency analysis scripts to ensure that the visualizations are up to date.
- Use version control to track changes in the scripts that generate these files, as this will help maintain consistency in the visualizations.
- When sharing the visualizations with others, ensure that they have access to the necessary context about the dependencies represented in the graphs.
