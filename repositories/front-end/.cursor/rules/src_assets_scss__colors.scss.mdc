# Overview
The `_colors.scss` file defines a set of color variables used throughout the project. These variables provide a centralized way to manage color values, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance across stylesheets.

# Key Components
- **Color Variables**: The file contains several SCSS variables that represent specific colors used in the application. Each variable is defined using the SCSS syntax for variables, prefixed with a dollar sign (`$`).
  - `$black`: Represents the color black with the hex value `#000000`.
  - `$bluecharcoal`: A dark blue color with the hex value `#010D17`.
  - `$charade`: A dark grayish color with the hex value `#2B2D37`.
  - `$ebonyclay`: A muted dark color with the hex value `#242B35`.
  - `$shark`: A very dark gray color with the hex value `#1A1B21`.
  - `$white`: Represents the color white with the hex value `#ffffff`.

# Dependencies
This file does not import any other SCSS files, nor is it imported by any other files in the repository. It serves as a standalone file that can be included in other SCSS files as needed.

# Usage Examples
To use these color variables in your SCSS files, you can simply reference them by their variable names. For example:
```scss
body {
    background-color: $white;
    color: $black;
}

.header {
    background-color: $bluecharcoal;
}
```

# Best Practices
- **Consistency**: Always use the defined color variables instead of hardcoding color values in your styles. This ensures that any changes to color values can be made in one place, improving maintainability.
- **Naming Conventions**: When adding new color variables, follow the existing naming conventions to maintain clarity and consistency in the codebase.
- **Documentation**: If new colors are added, document their purpose and usage to help other developers understand their context.
