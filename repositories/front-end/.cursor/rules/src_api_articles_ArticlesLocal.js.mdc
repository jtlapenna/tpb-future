# ArticlesLocal.js Documentation

## Overview
The `ArticlesLocal` class is a part of the local data management layer for articles in the application. It extends the `LocalRepo` class, providing a specific implementation for handling articles stored locally.

## Key Components
- **Class: ArticlesLocal**  
  The `ArticlesLocal` class inherits from `LocalRepo`. It is initialized with the parameters 'articles' and 'id', which define the collection name and the unique identifier for each article, respectively.

### Constructor
- **constructor()**  
  The constructor calls the parent class constructor with the arguments 'articles' and 'id'. This sets up the local repository for managing article data.

## Dependencies
- **Imports:**  
  - `LocalRepo` from `../LocalRepo`: This is the base class that provides common functionality for local data repositories.

- **Exports:**  
  - This file is imported by `src/api/articles/ArticlesRepo.js`, which likely uses `ArticlesLocal` to manage article data operations.

## Usage Example
To use the `ArticlesLocal` class, you would typically instantiate it and call its methods to interact with the local article data. For example:
```javascript
const articlesLocal = new ArticlesLocal();
// Use articlesLocal to perform operations like fetching, saving, or deleting articles.
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that any modifications to the `ArticlesLocal` class maintain the integrity of the data structure defined in the `LocalRepo` class.
- When extending functionality, consider the implications on performance and data consistency, especially if multiple components interact with the same local data.
- Keep the class focused on local data management; avoid adding unrelated functionalities that could complicate its purpose.
