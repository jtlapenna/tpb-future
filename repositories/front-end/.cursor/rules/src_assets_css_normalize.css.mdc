# normalize.css Documentation

## Overview
The `normalize.css` file is a CSS reset library that aims to provide cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements. It addresses common inconsistencies across different browsers, ensuring that elements render more consistently and in line with modern web standards.

## Purpose and Functionality
This file serves to correct common issues with default browser styles, such as line heights, margins, and font sizes. By applying a set of sensible defaults, it helps developers avoid the need for extensive resets and allows for a more predictable styling experience across various browsers.

## Key Components
- **HTML Element Styles**: Sets the line height and prevents font size adjustments in iOS.
- **Body Styles**: Removes default margins to ensure a clean slate for styling.
- **Headings**: Adjusts the font size and margin for `h1` elements to ensure consistency across browsers.
- **Text-level Semantics**: Styles for elements like `a`, `b`, `strong`, `code`, and others to ensure proper font weight and size.
- **Forms**: Normalizes styles for form elements, ensuring consistent appearance and behavior across browsers.
- **Interactive Elements**: Ensures that elements like `details` and `summary` display correctly in all browsers.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a foundational stylesheet that can be included in any project to ensure consistent styling.

## Usage Examples
To use `normalize.css`, simply include it in your HTML file within the `<head>` section:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/assets/css/normalize.css">
```

## Best Practices
- **Include Early**: Always include `normalize.css` at the beginning of your CSS files to ensure it applies before any custom styles.
- **Customize as Needed**: While `normalize.css` provides a solid foundation, feel free to customize styles further to fit your design needs.
- **Keep Updated**: Regularly check for updates to `normalize.css` to benefit from improvements and fixes made by the community.

By following these guidelines, developers can leverage `normalize.css` effectively to create a more consistent and reliable styling experience across different browsers.
