# How to Make a Deploy

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy a project to Firebase Hosting. It outlines the necessary steps to set up a new site in the Firebase console and how to configure your local project for deployment.

## Key Components
- **Firebase Console**: The web interface where you manage your Firebase projects, including hosting.
- **.firebaserc**: A configuration file in your project root that defines project aliases for Firebase commands.
- **firebase.json**: A configuration file that specifies the hosting settings for your Firebase project.

## Steps to Deploy
1. **Firebase Console Setup**:  
   - Navigate to the Firebase console and select your project.  
   - Go to **Hosting** and click on **Add another site**.  
   - Enter the desired name for your hosting site and click **Add Site**.

2. **Local Project Configuration**:  
   - Ensure you are logged in with an account that has access to the project.  
   - Run `firebase use` to confirm you are using the correct project.
   - Edit the **.firebaserc** file to add a new property under the projects object, using the same value as the default property.
   - Update the **firebase.json** file to include a new item in the hosting array, copying an existing item and changing the **target** property to match the new hosting site name.

3. **Deploying Changes**:  
   - Run the command:  
     ```bash  
     firebase target:apply hosting <identifier on .firebaserc> <hosting added on firebase>  
     ```  
   - Build your project with:  
     ```bash  
     npm run build  
     ```  
   - **Important**: Avoid committing the build if you are not on the master branch to keep your commit history clean.
   - Finally, deploy your changes with:  
     ```bash  
     firebase deploy --only hosting:<identifier added on .firebaserc>  
     ```

## Best Practices
- Always verify that you are on the correct Firebase project before deploying.
- Avoid committing build artifacts to your version control system unless necessary.
- Regularly check the Firebase console for any updates or changes to your hosting settings.
