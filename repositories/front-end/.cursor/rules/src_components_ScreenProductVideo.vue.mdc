# ScreenProductVideo Component

## Overview
The `ScreenProductVideo` component is a Vue.js component designed to display a full-screen video that plays automatically in a loop. It is intended for use in product screens where visual engagement is crucial. The video is set to autoplay, muted, and loop, ensuring a seamless viewing experience.

## Key Components
- **Template**: The template consists of a `<video>` element that sources its video from a prop called `videoSrc`. The video is styled to cover the entire screen and is set to autoplay, muted, and loop.
- **Props**:  
  - `videoSrc`: A required string prop that specifies the source URL of the video to be played.
- **Methods**:  
  - `startAnimatingOut()`: This method adds a `fade-out` class to the video element, triggering a CSS transition that fades the video out when called.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**:  
  - `created()`: Registers an event listener for `animate-full-screen-background` to trigger the `startAnimatingOut` method.
  - `beforeDestroy()`: Cleans up by removing the event listener when the component is destroyed.

## Dependencies
This component does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It operates independently, relying solely on the props passed to it.

## Usage Example
To use the `ScreenProductVideo` component, you can include it in a parent component as follows:
```vue
<template>
  <ScreenProductVideo videoSrc="path/to/video.mp4" />
</template>
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `videoSrc` prop is always provided to avoid runtime errors.
- Consider the performance implications of using large video files, especially on mobile devices.
- Use appropriate video formats and compression to optimize loading times and playback performance.
- Be mindful of user experience; provide alternative content or controls if necessary, especially for users who may not want to view the video.

By following these guidelines, developers can effectively integrate the `ScreenProductVideo` component into their applications, enhancing the visual appeal of product displays.
