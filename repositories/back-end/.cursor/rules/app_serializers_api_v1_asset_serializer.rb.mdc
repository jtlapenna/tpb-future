# AssetSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `AssetSerializer` class is part of the `Api::V1` module and is responsible for serializing asset objects into JSON format. It inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides a standard way to convert Ruby objects into JSON representations suitable for API responses.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `AssetSerializer`
  - **Inherits from**: `ActiveModel::Serializer`
  - **Attributes**: The serializer defines the following attributes to be included in the serialized output:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the asset.
    - `url`: The URL pointing to the asset's location.
    - `created_at`: The timestamp indicating when the asset was created.
    - `updated_at`: The timestamp indicating when the asset was last updated.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone as a serializer for asset objects within the API V1 context.

## Usage Example
To use the `AssetSerializer`, you would typically instantiate it with an asset object and render it in a controller action. For example:
```ruby
render json: AssetSerializer.new(asset)
```
This will produce a JSON response containing the specified attributes of the asset.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data you want to expose through your API.
- Keep the serializer focused on a single resource to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- Regularly review and update the serializer as the asset model evolves to ensure consistency in the API responses.
