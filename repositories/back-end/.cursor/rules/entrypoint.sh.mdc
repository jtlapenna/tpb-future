# entrypoint.sh Documentation

## Overview
The `entrypoint.sh` file serves as the initial script executed when starting the application. It is responsible for running database migrations and starting the Rails server, making it a crucial component for setting up the application environment.

## Key Components
- **Shebang Line**: `#!/usr/bin/env sh`
  - This line indicates that the script should be run in a shell environment.

- **Database Migration Command**: `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
  - This command runs the database migrations using Rake, ensuring that the database schema is up to date with the latest changes.

- **Rails Server Command**: `bundle exec rails s -p 3000 -b '0.0.0.0'`
  - This command starts the Rails server, binding it to all interfaces on port 3000, allowing external access to the application.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It operates independently to set up the application environment.

## Usage Example
To use this script, simply run it in your terminal:
```sh
sh entrypoint.sh
```
This will execute the database migrations and start the Rails server.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that your database is properly configured before running this script to avoid migration errors.
- Always check for pending migrations before starting the server to ensure the application runs smoothly.
- Consider using a process manager like `foreman` or `docker-compose` to manage the application lifecycle in a production environment.
