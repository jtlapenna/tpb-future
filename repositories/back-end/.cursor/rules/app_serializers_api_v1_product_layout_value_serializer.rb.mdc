# ProductLayoutValueSerializer

## Overview
The `ProductLayoutValueSerializer` is a serializer class that formats the output of product layout values for the API version 1. It is part of the `Api::V1` namespace and extends `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides a way to customize the JSON representation of the product layout values.

## Key Components
- **Module Structure**: The serializer is defined within the `Api::V1` module, indicating that it is part of the first version of the API.
- **Delegation**: The serializer delegates methods `element_text?`, `element_medium?`, and `element_dot?` to the object being serialized, allowing for conditional attributes based on the object's state.
- **Attributes**: The serializer defines several attributes:
  - `coord_x` and `coord_y`: Always included in the serialized output.
  - `width`: Included unless the object is identified as a dot element.
  - `link`: Included unless the object is identified as a text element.
  - `content`: Included only if the object is identified as a text element.
  - `asset`: Included only if the object is identified as a medium element, and it uses the `AssetSerializer` to format the asset if it exists.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It operates independently within the context of the API.

## Usage Example
To use this serializer, you would typically call it when rendering a product layout value in a controller action, like so:
```ruby
render json: @product_layout_value, serializer: Api::V1::ProductLayoutValueSerializer
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the methods delegated to the object (`element_text?`, `element_medium?`, `element_dot?`) are well-defined and return boolean values to avoid unexpected behavior in the serialization process.
- Keep the serializer focused on formatting and avoid including business logic within it. The serializer should only be responsible for how data is presented, not how it is processed.
- Regularly review and update the serializer as the API evolves to ensure it accurately reflects the current data structure and requirements.
