# CategorySerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `CategorySerializer` class is a part of the ActiveModel Serializers framework, which is used to serialize Ruby objects into JSON format. This particular serializer is responsible for defining how `Category` objects are represented when converted to JSON, specifically including the `id` and `name` attributes.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `CategorySerializer`
  - Inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to serialize Ruby objects.
  - **Attributes**: The serializer specifies two attributes to be included in the serialized output:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the category.
    - `name`: The name of the category.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a simple serializer for the `Category` model.

## Usage Example
When a `Category` object is rendered in a controller, the `CategorySerializer` will automatically be used to format the output. For example:
```ruby
class CategoriesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    category = Category.find(params[:id])
    render json: category
  end
end
```
In this example, when a `Category` is fetched and rendered, the output will include only the `id` and `name` attributes as defined in the `CategorySerializer`.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data that should be exposed to the API consumers.
- Keep the serializer simple and focused on the specific model it represents. If additional logic is needed, consider using custom methods or additional serializers as necessary.
- Regularly review and update the serializer as the underlying model changes to ensure consistency in the API responses.
