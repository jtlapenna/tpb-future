# TagInfoSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `TagInfoSerializer` class is a serializer that formats the output of tag information in the application. It is part of the ActiveModel Serializers framework, which is used to create JSON representations of Ruby objects. This serializer specifically handles the serialization of tag attributes for API responses.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `TagInfoSerializer`
  - Inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to convert Ruby objects into JSON.
  - **Attributes**: The serializer defines three attributes that will be included in the serialized output:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the tag.
    - `tag`: The name or label of the tag.
    - `description`: A brief description of the tag.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a serializer for the tag information.

## Usage Example
When a request is made to retrieve tag information, the `TagInfoSerializer` will be used to format the response. For example:
```ruby
# Assuming `tag` is an instance of a Tag model
render json: tag, serializer: TagInfoSerializer
```
This will produce a JSON response that includes the `id`, `tag`, and `description` attributes of the tag.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data model and are relevant for the API consumers.
- Keep the serializer lightweight and focused on the specific attributes needed for the response to avoid unnecessary data exposure.
- Regularly review and update the serializer as the underlying data model evolves to maintain consistency in API responses.
