# KioskMinimalSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `KioskMinimalSerializer` class is a serializer that defines how the `Kiosk` model is represented in JSON format. It is part of the ActiveModel::Serializer framework, which is used to create a structured JSON response for API endpoints in Ruby on Rails applications.

## Key Components
- **Class Definition**: `KioskMinimalSerializer` inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to serialize the `Kiosk` model.
- **Attributes**: The `attributes` method specifies which fields of the `Kiosk` model should be included in the serialized output. In this case, it includes `:id` and `:name`.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone as a serializer for the `Kiosk` model.

## Usage Example
To use the `KioskMinimalSerializer`, you would typically render a `Kiosk` object in a controller action like so:
```ruby
render json: @kiosk, serializer: KioskMinimalSerializer
```
This will return a JSON response containing only the `id` and `name` attributes of the `Kiosk` object.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer match the fields available in the `Kiosk` model.
- Keep the serializer lightweight by only including necessary attributes to optimize performance and reduce payload size.
- If additional attributes or relationships are needed in the future, consider creating a more comprehensive serializer instead of modifying this minimal one.
