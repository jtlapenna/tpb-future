# ImageSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `ImageSerializer` class is part of the `Api::V1` module and is responsible for serializing image objects into JSON format. It inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides a way to define how objects are represented in JSON, making it easier to work with APIs in a Rails application.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `ImageSerializer`
  - **Inherits from**: `ActiveModel::Serializer`
  - **Attributes**: The serializer defines the following attributes to be included in the serialized output:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the image.
    - `url`: The URL where the image can be accessed.
    - `created_at`: The timestamp when the image was created.
    - `updated_at`: The timestamp when the image was last updated.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone as a serializer for image objects within the API V1 context.

## Usage Example
To use the `ImageSerializer`, you would typically call it when rendering an image object in a controller action. For example:
```ruby
render json: @image, serializer: Api::V1::ImageSerializer
```
This will return a JSON representation of the `@image` object, including only the specified attributes.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer are relevant to the API consumers. Avoid including sensitive information that should not be exposed.
- Keep the serializer focused on a single model to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- If additional attributes or methods are needed in the future, consider extending the serializer rather than modifying existing attributes to prevent breaking changes.
