# TreezLog Class Documentation

## Overview
The `TreezLog` class is designed to handle logging for webhook and store synchronization events within the application. It provides a simple interface for logging debug messages to separate log files, allowing developers to track the behavior of webhooks and store synchronization processes.

## Key Components

### Class: TreezLog
- **Methods:**
  - `self.debug_webhooks(message=nil)`  
    This method initializes a logger for webhook events and logs a debug message if provided. The log file is located at `log/webhooks_treez_log.log`.
  - `self.debug_storesync(message=nil)`  
    Similar to `debug_webhooks`, this method initializes a logger for store synchronization events and logs a debug message if provided. The log file is located at `log/storesync_treez_log.log`.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It operates independently, relying solely on the Ruby standard library's `Logger` class and the Rails framework for file path resolution.

## Usage Examples
To log a webhook event:
```ruby
TreezLog.debug_webhooks("Webhook received with payload: {...}")
```
To log a store synchronization event:
```ruby
TreezLog.debug_storesync("Store sync completed successfully.")
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the log messages are informative and provide enough context for debugging.
- Avoid logging sensitive information in the logs to maintain security and privacy.
- Regularly monitor the log files to identify any issues with webhooks or store synchronization processes.
