# Overview
The `config.ru` file is a crucial component in Rack-based applications, serving as the entry point for the application when it is run on a Rack server. It is responsible for loading the application environment and initiating the application.

# Purpose and Functionality
This file is used to configure the Rack server to run a Ruby on Rails application. It requires the environment configuration and then runs the Rails application, allowing it to handle incoming web requests.

# Key Components
- **require_relative 'config/environment'**: This line loads the Rails application environment, which sets up the necessary configurations and dependencies for the application to function correctly.
- **run Rails.application**: This command tells Rack to run the Rails application, which is defined in the loaded environment. It is the main entry point for handling requests.

# Dependencies
- This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as the entry point for the application.

# Usage Examples
To start the application using this file, you would typically run a command like:
```bash
rackup config.ru
```
This command starts the Rack server and uses the `config.ru` file to load and run the Rails application.

# Best Practices
- Ensure that the `config/environment.rb` file is correctly set up to load all necessary components of your Rails application.
- Keep the `config.ru` file clean and minimal, focusing solely on the application startup process.
- Regularly review and test the application startup process to ensure that all dependencies are correctly loaded and that the application runs smoothly.
