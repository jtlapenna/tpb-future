# AttributeValueSerializer

## Overview
The `AttributeValueSerializer` class is responsible for serializing the `AttributeValue` model into a format suitable for API responses. It leverages the `ActiveModel::Serializer` framework to define how the model's attributes should be represented in JSON format.

## Key Components
- **Class Definition**: `AttributeValueSerializer` inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to convert the model into a JSON representation.
- **Attributes**: The serializer specifies two attributes to be included in the serialized output: `id` and `value`. These attributes represent the unique identifier and the actual value of the attribute, respectively.
- **Associations**: The `belongs_to :attribute_def` line indicates that each `AttributeValue` is associated with an `AttributeDef` model. This relationship will be included in the serialized output, allowing clients to access related data easily.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a serializer for the `AttributeValue` model.

## Usage Examples
When an API request is made to retrieve an `AttributeValue`, the serializer will format the response as follows:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "value": "Sample Value",
  "attribute_def": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Sample Attribute"
  }
}
```
This output includes the `id` and `value` of the `AttributeValue`, as well as the associated `AttributeDef` data.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data needed by the API consumers.
- Keep the serializer lightweight by only including necessary attributes and associations to optimize performance.
- Regularly review and update the serializer as the underlying model changes to maintain consistency in API responses.
