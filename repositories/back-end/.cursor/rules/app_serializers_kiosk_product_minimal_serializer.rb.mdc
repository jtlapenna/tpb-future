# KioskProductMinimalSerializer

## Overview
The `KioskProductMinimalSerializer` is a serializer class that provides a minimal representation of kiosk products in the application. It is designed to be used with the ActiveModel::Serializer framework, which allows for easy serialization of Ruby objects into JSON format.

## Key Components
- **Class Definition**: The class `KioskProductMinimalSerializer` inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to serialize Ruby objects.
- **Attributes**: The serializer defines two attributes to be included in the serialized output:
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the kiosk product.
  - `featured`: A boolean indicating whether the product is featured.
- **Associations**:
  - `belongs_to :store_product`: This establishes a relationship with the `StoreProductMinimalSerializer`, allowing the serializer to include a minimal representation of the associated store product.
  - `has_one :store`: This establishes a relationship with the `StoreMinimalSerializer`, allowing the serializer to include a minimal representation of the associated store.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a serializer specifically for kiosk products.

## Usage Examples
To use this serializer, you would typically call it within a controller action that responds with JSON. For example:
```ruby
render json: @kiosk_product, serializer: KioskProductMinimalSerializer
```
This would serialize the `@kiosk_product` instance using the defined attributes and associations.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer are relevant to the API consumers. Avoid including unnecessary data to keep the response lightweight.
- When adding new attributes or associations, consider the impact on performance and the size of the serialized output.
- Keep the serializer focused on a single responsibility, which is to represent the kiosk product minimally, without adding business logic or complex transformations.
