# LayoutPositionPolicy Documentation

## Overview
The `LayoutPositionPolicy` class is a policy class that inherits from `ApplicationPolicy`. It is designed to manage permissions related to layout positions within the application. This class serves as a placeholder for defining authorization rules specific to layout positions, although currently, it does not implement any specific rules.

## Key Components
- **Class Definition**: `LayoutPositionPolicy` inherits from `ApplicationPolicy`, which means it can utilize any methods or properties defined in the parent class. 

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone as a policy class, which may be extended in the future to include specific authorization logic.

## Usage Examples
While there are no specific methods defined in this class yet, it can be used in conjunction with controllers or services that require authorization checks for layout positions. For example:

```ruby
if LayoutPositionPolicy.new(user, layout_position).update?
  # Allow update action
else
  # Deny update action
end
```

## Best Practices
- **Extending Functionality**: As the application grows, consider adding specific methods to this policy class to handle various authorization checks related to layout positions. For example, methods like `create?`, `update?`, or `destroy?` can be implemented to define who can perform these actions.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that any new methods added to this policy are consistent with the naming conventions and logic used in other policy classes within the application.
- **Documentation**: Keep the documentation updated as new methods are added to provide clarity on the purpose and usage of each method.
