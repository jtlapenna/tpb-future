# AdBannerLocationSerializer

## Overview
The `AdBannerLocationSerializer` is a serializer class that is part of the API version 1 namespace. It is responsible for defining how the `AdBannerLocation` model is represented in JSON format when it is serialized for API responses. This serializer uses the `ActiveModel::Serializer` framework to specify which attributes of the model should be included in the serialized output.

## Key Components
- **Class Definition**: The class `AdBannerLocationSerializer` inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to serialize the model.
- **Attributes**: The `attributes` method is called to define the list of attributes that will be included in the serialized output. In this case, the attributes are:
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the ad banner location.
  - `text`: The textual content associated with the ad banner location.
  - `codename`: A unique code name for the ad banner location.
  - `special_type`: A type designation that may affect how the ad banner is displayed or used.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a serializer for the `AdBannerLocation` model, which means it is specifically tailored for use within the API V1 context.

## Usage Example
When an instance of `AdBannerLocation` is serialized, it will return a JSON object that includes the specified attributes. For example:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "text": "Welcome to our site!",
  "codename": "homepage_banner",
  "special_type": "featured"
}
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data you want to expose through the API. Avoid including sensitive information.
- Keep the serializer focused on a single model to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- If additional logic is needed for formatting or conditional attributes, consider overriding the `attributes` method or using custom methods within the serializer.
