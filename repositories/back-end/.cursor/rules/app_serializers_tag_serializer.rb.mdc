# TagSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `TagSerializer` class is a part of the ActiveModel Serializers framework, which is used to serialize Ruby objects into JSON format. This specific serializer is designed to handle the serialization of `Tag` objects, focusing on the `name` attribute.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `TagSerializer`
  - Inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to convert Ruby objects into JSON.
  - **Attributes**: The only attribute defined for serialization is `:name`, meaning that when a `Tag` object is serialized, only the `name` field will be included in the output JSON.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a simple serializer for the `Tag` model.

## Usage Example
To use the `TagSerializer`, you would typically call it when rendering a `Tag` object in a controller. For example:
```ruby
render json: @tag, serializer: TagSerializer
```
This will output a JSON representation of the `@tag` object, including only the `name` attribute.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data you want to expose through your API. In this case, only exposing the `name` attribute is appropriate if that is the only information needed by the client.
- If additional attributes are required in the future, they can be added to the `attributes` line in the serializer.
- Keep serializers focused and lightweight to maintain performance and clarity in your API responses.
