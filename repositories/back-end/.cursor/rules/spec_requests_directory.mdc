## Relationship to Other Parts of the Codebase
The `spec/requests` directory is integral to the testing framework of the application, ensuring that the API behaves as expected. It interacts closely with the models and controllers defined in the application, providing a layer of validation for the endpoints exposed to clients.

## Common Patterns or Conventions Used
- Each spec file typically corresponds to a specific model or feature, following a naming convention that reflects its purpose.
- Request specs often utilize RSpec's `describe` and `it` blocks to structure tests clearly, making it easy to understand the expected behavior of each endpoint.

## Best Practices When Working with Files in This Directory
- Keep tests focused and concise, ensuring that each spec file tests a single aspect of the API.
- Use `let` and `before` blocks to set up common data and states, reducing duplication across tests.
- Regularly run the test suite to ensure that changes in the application do not break existing functionality.
- Write clear and descriptive test cases that explain the purpose of each test, making it easier for others to understand the intent behind the tests.
