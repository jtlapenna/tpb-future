## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
1. Well-structured API versioning
2. Comprehensive test setup
3. Clear separation of concerns
4. Strong validation on models
5. Proper error handling
6. Automated API documentation
7. Modular architecture with distinct feature areas
8. Background job processing with Sidekiq
9. Caching with Redis

### Areas for Improvement
1. Missing API versioning strategy documentation
2. No rate limiting implementation
3. Limited error response standardization
4. Missing API authentication documentation
5. Need to add more comprehensive API examples
6. Complex domain with many interconnected models
7. Potential for service object refactoring
8. Need for API response caching strategy

## Next Steps
1. Document API versioning strategy
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Standardize error responses
4. Add authentication documentation
5. Enhance test coverage for edge cases
6. Consider service object refactoring for complex operations
7. Implement API response caching
8. Add API monitoring and analytics
