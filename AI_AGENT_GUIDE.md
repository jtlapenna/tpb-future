# AI Agent Quick Reference Guide

## Project Overview
The Peak Beyond (TPB) Future project contains legacy cannabis retail systems, strategic planning documents, and modern e-commerce extensions. The goal is to stabilize legacy systems while building V2 foundation for AI agent economy integration.

## Repository Quick Reference

| Repository | Technology | Purpose | Status |
|------------|------------|---------|---------|
| `back-end/` | Rails + PostgreSQL | Core API | Production (needs stabilization) |
| `cms-fe-angular/` | Angular 8 | Content Management | Legacy (freeze new features) |
| `front-end/` | Vue.js 2 | Kiosk Displays | Legacy (target for React migration) |
| `TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE/` | React + NestJS | Modern E-commerce | Incomplete (V2 reference) |

## Key Strategic Concepts

### V1 Stabilization Strategy
- **Principle**: Every V1 fix must reduce support burden AND become V2 building block
- **Focus**: POS/CMS sync, API contracts, auth/security, observability
- **Timeline**: 30/60/90 day execution plan

### V2 Foundation
- **Keystone**: User accounts as the spine
- **Architecture**: API Gateway + domain services + agent-ready contracts
- **Goal**: Position as vertical intelligence layer for cannabis retail

### Dual Revenue Engines
- **Engine A**: Affiliate/content feeds (outside cannabis) â†’ near-term cash
- **Engine B**: Retail Data SaaS + Cannabis Agent API (inside cannabis) â†’ scale

## Development Workflow

### For Legacy System Maintenance
1. **Read**: `cursor_rules/[repo]/rules/` for standards
2. **Understand**: `knowledge-bases/[repo]/` for context
3. **Code**: Follow established patterns in `repositories/[repo]/`
4. **Test**: Use patterns from `knowledge-bases/[repo]/technical/testing/`

### For V2 Development
1. **Plan**: Review `future-considerations/9_target_architecture_appendix.md`
2. **Reference**: Study `TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE/` for modern patterns
3. **Standards**: Follow `cursor_rules/` guidelines
4. **Integrate**: Use `knowledge-bases/cross-repository-knowledge-base/` for system understanding

### For Strategic Analysis
1. **Context**: Start with `future-considerations/1_opening_reality_check_opportunity.md`
2. **Current State**: Review `knowledge-bases/cross-repository-knowledge-base/`
3. **Future Vision**: Study `future-considerations/8_12_24_month_hybrid_roadmap_quarter_by_quarter.md`
4. **Implementation**: Reference `TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE/` for modern patterns

## Common Patterns

### API Development
- **Legacy**: Rails controllers with serializers (`repositories/back-end/app/`)
- **Modern**: NestJS modules with DTOs (`TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE/ThePeakBeyond_eCommerce_API/src/`)
- **Standards**: RESTful design with versioning (`cursor_rules/api/rules/`)

### Frontend Development
- **Legacy**: Vue.js components with Vuex (`repositories/front-end/src/`)
- **Modern**: React components with Redux (`TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE/ThePeakBeyond_eCommerce/src/`)
- **Standards**: Component-based architecture (`cursor_rules/frontend/rules/`)

### Data Management
- **Legacy**: ActiveRecord models (`repositories/back-end/app/models/`)
- **Modern**: TypeORM entities (`TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE/ThePeakBeyond_eCommerce_API/src/models/`)
- **Patterns**: Repository pattern, service layer (`knowledge-bases/api-knowledge-base/`)

## Success Metrics

### V1 Stabilization
- Sync success rate â‰¥ 99% daily
- Support hours reduction by 25%
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) improvement

### V2 Development
- User account adoption and personalization uplift
- API partner adoption and revenue growth
- Agent-ready data feeds and contracts

### Strategic Goals
- Position as vertical intelligence layer for cannabis retail
- Dual revenue streams (affiliate + data SaaS)
- AI agent economy integration
