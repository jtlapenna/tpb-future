# **The Ask / Next Steps**

To move forward effectively, we need clear alignment and approvals across three immediate initiatives, plus a green light to begin shaping the long-term differentiator:

---

## **1. Stabilization Items (Immediate)**
- **Objective:** Reduce reactive support burden and prevent customer churn by hardening today’s system.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Harden CMS ↔ POS sync reliability (circuit breakers, retries, structured logs).
  - Standardize error handling and monitoring across repos.
  - Automate dependency/security updates (Dependabot, audits).
- **Approval Needed:** Dedicated bandwidth for stabilization tasks, framed as essential groundwork for V2.

---

## **2. Front-End & User Accounts Initiative (Next 6–12 Months)**
- **Objective:** Rebuild the customer-facing front-end in a modern framework to support **user accounts**.
- **Why Accounts Matter:**
  - Retailer dashboards, campaigns, personalization.
  - Shopper profiles, preferences, loyalty programs.
  - Identity/consent layer that future AI agents will use to interact with TPB.
- **Approval Needed:** Prioritize front-end rebuild with accounts as the first major V2 feature.

---

## **3. Data Enrichment & Organization (Parallel Track)**
- **Objective:** Prepare TPB’s dataset to power personalization, dashboards, and future APIs.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Expand ingestion to include terpenes, effects, lab data.
  - Normalize schemas; build validation scripts.
  - Begin domain-by-domain enrichment (products first).
- **Approval Needed:** Commitment to prioritize data as a strategic asset, not an afterthought.

---

## **4. Cannabis Agent API Alpha (12–18 Month Horizon)**
- **Objective:** Establish TPB as the **intelligence layer of cannabis retail** in the agent economy.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Draft and prototype alpha endpoints (strain/effect lookups, compliance filters).
  - Pilot with 1–2 partner stores.
  - Position API as the bridge between dispensaries, shoppers, and their AI agents.
- **Approval Needed:** Agreement to scope and schedule API alpha as part of the V2 roadmap.

---

# **Next Steps**

1. **Leadership approval** to proceed with stabilization backlog, accounts rebuild, and data enrichment as immediate priorities.
2. **Resourcing decision** on engineering hours (stabilization + FE rebuild) vs. new feature pressure.
3. **Schedule a working session** to scope the Cannabis Agent API alpha (targeting 12–18 month milestone).
4. **Confirm alignment** with stakeholders that V2 = **identity + data + agent readiness**, not a one-to-one rebuild of V1.

---

✅ With these approvals, we can sequence execution to: stabilize today, modernize the front door with accounts, enrich the data engine, and begin building the API layer that positions TPB as the bridge into the agent economy.
