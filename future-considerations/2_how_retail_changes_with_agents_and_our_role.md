# How Retail Changes with Agents (and Our Role)

## The Retail Shift
Retail is moving from **search & browse** to **ask & delegate**. Shoppers will use **personal AI agents** that know their preferences, budget, constraints, and values to plan, compare, and purchase—at home and inside stores. In physical retail, a new three‑way conversation emerges:

**Human ↔ Store Agent ↔ Personal Agent**

- The **personal agent** represents the shopper (dietary/health constraints, tolerance, budget, brand ethics).
- The **store agent** represents the retailer (inventory, pricing, compliance, promotions, loyalty rules).
- The **human** remains in the loop—reviewing options, consenting to data use, and making the final call.

---

## At Home: Delegated Shopping
- “Plan a month of relaxing night‑time products under $200; avoid anything that disrupts sleep.”
- The agent assembles a short list across retailers, checks availability, applies loyalty discounts, and schedules pickup or delivery.
- Subscriptions and replenishment become **agent‑managed** with auto‑switching when inventory or prices change.

**Implication:** Discovery shifts upstream to agents. Retailers that provide **clean, trustworthy, and rich data** become most visible to agents—and therefore to shoppers.

---

## In‑Store: Bring‑Your‑Agent Shopping
- Shoppers “pair” their agent to the store (QR, NFC, or passkey) for the session.
- When a product is lifted at a TPB station, the **store agent** and **personal agent** exchange context: effects, contraindications, past reactions, budget.
- The station surfaces human‑readable recommendations while personal agents record choices and update the shopper’s plan.

**Implication:** Stations are no longer just kiosks—they’re **agent gateways** that translate between people, product, and policy.

## What Agents Need from Retailers
- **Identity & Consent:** Who is this shopper? What has the shopper consented to share/do (budgets, preferences, medical constraints)?
- **Structured Product Data:** SKU → strain/form, terpenes, effects, lab data, dosage, price, promotions, availability by location.
- **Policies & Compliance:** State‑specific rules, age/ID checks, purchase limits.
- **Event Interfaces:** Webhooks/events for carts, reservations, substitutions, pickup ETA.

**Bottom line:** Agents thrive on **schemas + contracts** (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI) and **policy‑aware logic**.

## Our Role (The Peak Beyond)
1) **Displays as Agent Gateways**  
   - Pairing UI (QR/passkey), session consent prompts, on‑device tips.  
   - Real‑time comparisons and “safer alternatives” surfaced visually.  
   - Physical interaction (lift‑to‑learn) becomes a high‑signal event feed.

2) **User Accounts as the Spine**  
   - Identity + consent ledger (scopes for agents).  
   - Shopper profiles (preferences, sensitivity, budget) and retailer dashboards (promotions, segments).

3) **Cannabis Agent API**  
   - The vertical **intelligence layer**: effects/terpenes, availability, compliance; explanation‑ready responses for agents.  
   - Starts with the **Products domain**, then expands to pairings and predicted outcomes.

4) **Retail Data SaaS**  
   - Dashboards and recommendations for staff; campaign tools tied to agent‑visible offers.  
   - Attribution for **agent‑initiated** vs **human‑initiated** conversions.

5) **Outside Cannabis: Agent‑Ready Feeds**  
   - Our affiliate hub outputs **HTML (for people) + JSON (for agents)**.  
   - Niche catalogs (eco, longevity, parenting) become licensable feeds for agent builders.

## Business Model Shifts & New Metrics
- **From pageviews → agent queries.**
- **From impressions → consented personalization rate.** (what % of in‑store sessions pair an agent?)
- **From generic AOV → agent‑uplifted AOV** (basket size when agent participates).
- **From ‘kiosk usage’ → ‘agent‑assisted conversions’.**

Revenue expands beyond hardware/SaaS to **API subscriptions, data SaaS, and feed licensing**.

---

## Competitive Reality
- Foundation models/platforms (Apple/Google/OpenAI/Anthropic) will own the agent OS.  
- **Vertical providers** who own trusted data + compliant transactions will win **distribution inside agents**.  
- Cannabis is compliance‑heavy—exactly where vertical intelligence is most valuable.

---

## Day‑One → Year‑Two Vignettes
- **Day 1:** Shoppers pair their agent at a TPB display; the station suggests a calming alternative based on the agent’s sleep profile; checkout is faster and safer.
- **Month 6:** Retailers run a “new‑to‑store gentle edibles” campaign; store agent offers appear on stations and inside personal agents; attribution logs in the dashboard.
- **Year 2:** The **Cannabis Agent API** powers third‑party agents; our stations act as high‑trust endpoints; outside‑cannabis feeds generate licensing revenue.

---

## Why This Is Winnable for Us
- We already operate **in‑store** with **hundreds of live displays** and an **8‑year dataset**.  
- By enriching data, standardizing contracts, and making accounts the spine, we become the **agent‑ready retail intelligence layer**—not easily displaced by generic platforms.
