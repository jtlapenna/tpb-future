# Kiosk Product List Component Styles

## Overview
This SCSS file contains styles specifically for the kiosk product list component, particularly focusing on the appearance of featured items. It enhances the user interface by providing visual cues for interactive elements.

## Key Components
- **.featured**: This class is used to style featured items within the kiosk product list. It serves as a container for elements that are highlighted to attract user attention.
- **.fa**: This nested class applies styles to Font Awesome icons within the featured items. It sets the cursor to a pointer, indicating that the icons are interactive, and adjusts the font size for better visibility.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other styles or files, nor is it imported by any other files in the repository. It is a standalone stylesheet that directly styles the kiosk product list component.

## Usage Examples
To use the styles defined in this file, ensure that the `featured` class is applied to the appropriate elements in the kiosk product list component's HTML template. For example:
```html
<div class="featured">
  <i class="fa fa-star"></i> Featured Product
</div>
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `featured` class is only applied to items that are genuinely featured to maintain clarity and user experience.
- When using Font Awesome icons, make sure to keep the icon sizes consistent across the application for a uniform look.
- Regularly review and update styles as needed to align with design changes or user feedback.
