# Kiosk Product Layout Component Styles

## Overview
This SCSS file contains the styling for the kiosk product layout component of the application. It defines the visual presentation of the page title and subtitle, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the kiosk interface.

## Key Components
- **`.page-title`**: This class styles the main title of the page. It includes a bottom margin to create space between the title and subsequent content.
  - **Margin**: `1rem` bottom margin to separate it from the content below.

- **`.page-subtitle`**: This class styles the subtitle of the page. It is designed to be visually distinct from the main title, using a larger font size and italic style.
  - **Font Size**: `1.5rem` to make it prominent.
  - **Font Style**: `italic` to differentiate it from regular text.
  - **Margin**: `2.5rem` bottom margin to provide ample space before the next section.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other styles or files, nor is it imported by any other files in the repository. It is a standalone stylesheet specifically for the kiosk product layout component.

## Usage Examples
To use these styles, simply apply the classes to the relevant HTML elements in your kiosk product layout component template:
```html
<h1 class="page-title">Kiosk Product</h1>
<h2 class="page-subtitle">Your one-stop shop for all products</h2>
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the class names are used consistently across the component to maintain a uniform style.
- When modifying styles, consider the impact on the overall layout and ensure that changes do not disrupt the visual hierarchy.
- Keep the styles modular and avoid adding unnecessary complexity to maintain readability and ease of maintenance.
