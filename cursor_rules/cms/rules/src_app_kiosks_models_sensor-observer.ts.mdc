# SensorObserver Interface Documentation

## Overview
The `SensorObserver` interface defines a contract for observing sensor data in a reactive manner using RxJS Observables. It provides a structured way to access sensor availability, type, and values, as well as methods to manage thresholds and clean up resources.

## Key Components
- **available**: `Observable<boolean>`  
  This observable indicates whether the sensor is currently available. Subscribers can react to changes in availability.

- **type**: `Observable<string>`  
  This observable provides the type of the sensor as a string. It allows consumers to understand what kind of sensor they are dealing with.

- **values**: `Observable<any>`  
  This observable emits the current values from the sensor. The type is `any` to accommodate various sensor data types.

- **setThreshold(value: number)**:  
  This method allows setting a threshold value for the sensor. The specific behavior of this method will depend on the implementation of the interface.

- **dispose()**: `void`  
  This method is used to clean up resources when the sensor observer is no longer needed. It should be called to prevent memory leaks.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository and is not imported by any other files. It stands alone as a definition for the `SensorObserver` interface.

## Usage Example
To implement the `SensorObserver` interface, a class might look like this:
```typescript
class MySensor implements SensorObserver {
    available = new Observable<boolean>(observer => { /* logic */ });
    type = new Observable<string>(observer => { /* logic */ });
    values = new Observable<any>(observer => { /* logic */ });

    setThreshold(value: number) {
        // Implementation for setting threshold
    }

    dispose() {
        // Cleanup logic
    }
}
```

## Best Practices
- Always ensure to call the `dispose()` method when the observer is no longer needed to free up resources.
- When implementing the `SensorObserver`, consider the types of data that will be emitted and ensure that the observables are properly managed to avoid memory leaks.
- Use the `setThreshold` method judiciously, ensuring that the threshold values are within acceptable limits for the specific sensor type.
