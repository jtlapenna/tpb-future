# ClientsModule Documentation

## Overview
The `ClientsModule` is an Angular module that manages the client-related components and services within the application. It sets up routing for client-related views and provides the necessary services to handle client data.

## Key Components
- **ClientListComponent**: Displays a list of clients. This component is the default view when navigating to the clients module.
- **ClientComponent**: Used for creating a new client or editing an existing client. It is displayed when navigating to the `/new` or `/:id/edit` routes.
- **ClientService**: A service that handles the business logic and data retrieval for client-related operations.

## Routing
The module defines the following routes:
- `''`: Displays the `ClientListComponent`.
- `'/new'`: Displays the `ClientComponent` for creating a new client.
- `':id/edit'`: Displays the `ClientComponent` for editing an existing client based on the provided ID.

## Dependencies
This module imports the following:
- **SharedModule**: Contains shared components, directives, and pipes used across the application.
- **RouterModule**: Configures the routing for the module using the defined routes.

### Imported By
The `ClientsModule` is imported by `src/app/layout/layout.routes.ts`, which likely integrates it into the main application routing structure.

## Usage Example
To use the `ClientsModule`, ensure it is imported in the main application module or a parent module that handles routing. The routes defined will allow navigation to the client list and client creation/editing views.

## Best Practices
- Keep the components and services organized within their respective directories to maintain clarity.
- Ensure that the `ClientService` is properly handling API calls and error management to provide a smooth user experience.
- Use Angular's dependency injection to manage service instances effectively.
