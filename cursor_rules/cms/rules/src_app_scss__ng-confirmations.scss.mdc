# _ng-confirmations.scss Documentation

## Overview
The `_ng-confirmations.scss` file contains the styling rules for the confirmation dialog component used in the application. This component is designed to provide users with a visual confirmation prompt, typically for actions that require user validation, such as deletions or important decisions.

## Key Components
- **.jaspero__confirmation_dialog**: This class styles the confirmation dialog box. The key properties include:
  - `display: block !important;`: Ensures that the dialog is displayed as a block element, overriding any other display settings.
  - `top: 50% !important;`: Positions the dialog vertically centered in the viewport.
  - `bottom: unset !important;`: Resets any bottom positioning to ensure proper centering.
  - `transform: translate(0, -50%);`: Adjusts the dialog's position to perfectly center it by translating it upwards by half of its height.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other SCSS files, nor is it imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone in its functionality, meaning it is self-contained and does not rely on external styles or components.

## Usage Examples
To use the confirmation dialog in your HTML, you would typically include the following structure:
```html
<div class="jaspero__confirmation_dialog">
  <p>Are you sure you want to proceed?</p>
  <button>Yes</button>
  <button>No</button>
</div>
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the confirmation dialog is only used when necessary to avoid overwhelming users with prompts.
- Maintain accessibility standards by ensuring that the dialog can be navigated using a keyboard and is screen reader friendly.
- Keep the content of the dialog clear and concise to facilitate user understanding and decision-making.
