# Environment Configuration File

## Overview
The `environment.aim-2.ts` file is a configuration file that defines environment-specific settings for the AIM services application. It is primarily used to manage different configurations for development and production environments.

## Key Components
- **production**: A boolean flag indicating whether the application is running in production mode. When set to `true`, it signifies that the application should use production settings.
- **apiUrl**: A string that holds the base URL for the API that the application will interact with. In this case, it points to the production API endpoint.
- **rfidSensorUrl**: A string that specifies the URL for the RFID sensor service. This is typically set to a local development server during development.
- **SENTRY_DSN**: A string containing the Data Source Name (DSN) for Sentry, which is used for error tracking and monitoring in the application.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It serves as a standalone configuration file that can be referenced directly in the application code where needed.

## Usage Examples
To use the configuration values defined in this file, you can import the `environment` object in your application code as follows:
```javascript
import { environment } from './src/environments/environment.aim-2';

console.log(environment.apiUrl); // Outputs: https://tpb-api.aimservices.tech
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that sensitive information, such as the SENTRY_DSN, is not exposed in public repositories. Consider using environment variables or a secure vault for production secrets.
- When deploying to production, verify that the `production` flag is set to `true` to avoid using development settings inadvertently.
- Regularly review and update the API URLs and other configurations to reflect any changes in the backend services.
