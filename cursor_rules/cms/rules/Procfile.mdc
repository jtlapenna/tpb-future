# Procfile Documentation

## Overview
The `Procfile` is a configuration file used by platforms like Heroku to determine how to run your application. It specifies the commands that are executed by the applicationâ€™s dynos. In this case, it defines a web process that runs a Node.js server.

## Key Components
- **web**: This is the process type that Heroku will use to start the web server. The command associated with this process type is `node server.js`, which starts the Node.js application.

## File Purpose and Functionality
The primary purpose of the `Procfile` is to declare the types of processes that are run by the application. In this instance, it indicates that the application has a web server that listens for incoming requests. The command `node server.js` tells the system to execute the `server.js` file using Node.js, which is typically where the main application logic resides.

## Dependencies
This `Procfile` does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a configuration file that is essential for deployment but does not directly interact with the codebase's logic.

## Usage Example
To use this `Procfile`, ensure that you have a `server.js` file in the root of your project that contains the necessary code to start your web server. When deploying to a platform like Heroku, the platform will read this file and execute the specified command to start your application.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the command specified in the `Procfile` is correct and points to the main entry point of your application.
- Keep the `Procfile` in the root directory of your project for easy access and recognition by deployment platforms.
- Regularly test your application locally to ensure that the command works as expected before deploying to production.
