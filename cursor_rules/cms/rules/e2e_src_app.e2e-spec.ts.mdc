# End-to-End Test Specification for peak-beyond-web

## Overview
This file contains end-to-end tests for the `peak-beyond-web` application using Protractor. It verifies that the application behaves as expected by checking the welcome message displayed on the main page.

## Key Components
- **AppPage**: This is a page object that encapsulates the interactions with the application’s UI. It is imported from `app.po.ts` and is used to navigate to the application and retrieve text from the UI.
- **describe**: This function groups related tests. In this case, it describes the test suite for the `peak-beyond-web` application.
- **beforeEach**: This function is executed before each test, ensuring that a new instance of `AppPage` is created for each test case.
- **it**: This function defines an individual test case. The test checks if the welcome message is displayed correctly.
- **afterEach**: This function runs after each test to check for any severe errors in the browser logs, ensuring that the application does not emit any critical errors during the tests.

## Dependencies
This file imports the following:
- `app.po.ts`: Contains the `AppPage` class which provides methods to interact with the application’s UI.

This file is not imported by any other files in the repository, indicating it is a standalone test file specifically for end-to-end testing.

## Usage Example
To run the tests defined in this file, you can use the Protractor command:
```bash
protractor conf.js
```
Make sure that the Protractor configuration file (`conf.js`) is set up correctly to point to the test files.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the application is running before executing the tests to avoid connection errors.
- Regularly update the tests to reflect any changes in the application’s UI or functionality.
- Use descriptive test names to make it clear what each test is verifying.
- Keep the tests isolated and independent to ensure that they can run in any order without affecting each other.
