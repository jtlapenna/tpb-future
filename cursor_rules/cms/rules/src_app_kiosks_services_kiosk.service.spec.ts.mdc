# KioskService Test Suite

## Overview
This file contains unit tests for the `KioskService` class, which is responsible for managing kiosk-related operations in the application. The tests ensure that the service behaves as expected when interacting with the backend API for RFID products.

## Key Components
- **Imports**: The file imports necessary modules from Angular's testing framework and the `KioskService` itself. It also imports `HttpClientTestingModule` and `HttpTestingController` to facilitate HTTP request testing.
- **Test Suite**: The main test suite is defined using `describe`, which groups related tests for the `KioskService`.
- **Setup**: The `beforeEach` function initializes the testing environment, creating an instance of `KioskService` and setting up the HTTP mock controller.
- **Tests**: The suite includes tests to verify the creation of the service and to check the functionality of the `rfidsProducts` method, which retrieves RFID products from the backend.

## Tests Explained
1. **Service Creation**: The first test checks if the `KioskService` is created successfully.
2. **Retrieving RFID Products**: The second test verifies that the `rfidsProducts` method returns the correct list of RFID products when called with a specific kiosk ID.
3. **Sorted RFID Products**: The third test checks if the `rfidsProducts` method returns the RFID products sorted according to the specified order, ensuring that unavailable products are listed first.

## Dependencies
This test file directly depends on the `KioskService` located at `src/app/kiosks/services/kiosk.service.ts`. It does not serve as a dependency for any other files in the repository.

## Usage Examples
To run the tests, use the Angular CLI command:
```bash
ng test
```
This will execute the test suite and provide feedback on the success or failure of each test case.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the backend API is running and accessible at the specified URL during testing.
- Keep the test data (like `rfidProducts`) consistent to avoid flaky tests.
- Use descriptive test names to clarify the purpose of each test case.
- Regularly update tests when the `KioskService` functionality changes to maintain accuracy.
