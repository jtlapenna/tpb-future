# Overview

The `src/main.ts` file serves as the main entry point for the Angular application. It is responsible for bootstrapping the root module (`AppModule`) and initializing Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.

# Key Components

- **Sentry Initialization**: The file imports Sentry and configures it with the DSN from the environment settings. It also sets up browser tracing to monitor performance and routing instrumentation.
- **Production Mode**: The application checks if it is running in production mode and enables Angular's production optimizations if true.
- **Bootstrap Module**: The `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)` function is called to start the application by bootstrapping the `AppModule`.

# Dependencies

This file imports the following modules:
- `src/app/app.module.ts`: This is the root module of the Angular application, which declares and provides the components, services, and other modules used in the application.
- `src/environments/environment.ts`: This file contains environment-specific settings, including the Sentry DSN and a flag indicating whether the application is in production mode.

This file is not imported by any other files in the repository, making it a standalone entry point for the application.

# Usage Examples

To run the application, simply execute the Angular CLI command:
```bash
ng serve
```
This will compile the application and serve it locally, using the configurations defined in `environment.ts`.

# Best Practices

- **Environment Configuration**: Ensure that the `environment.ts` file is properly configured for different environments (development, production) to avoid exposing sensitive information.
- **Error Tracking**: Regularly monitor Sentry for any reported errors and performance issues to maintain application health.
- **Production Mode**: Always test the application in production mode to catch any issues that may not appear in development mode.
