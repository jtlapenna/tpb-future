# KioskProductLayoutComponent Spec

## Overview
This file contains unit tests for the `KioskProductLayoutComponent`, which is part of an Angular application. The tests are designed to ensure that the component is created successfully and functions as expected within the application.

## Key Components
- **KioskProductLayoutComponent**: The main component being tested. It is responsible for rendering the layout of kiosk products.
- **KioskProductLayoutElementListComponent**: A child component that is declared within the test module, which may be used by the `KioskProductLayoutComponent` to display a list of elements.
- **KioskService**: A service that provides data to the component. In the tests, it is mocked to provide a simple data structure for testing purposes.

## File Structure
- **Imports**: The file imports necessary modules and components, including Angular testing utilities, the `EditorModule` for rich text editing, and a custom testing module (`PeakTestingModule`). It also imports the components and services that are essential for the tests.
- **Test Suite**: The `describe` block defines a test suite for the `KioskProductLayoutComponent`. Inside this suite, the component is set up and tested.

## Dependencies
This file relies on several other files in the codebase:
- `src/app/test`: Contains the `PeakTestingModule`, which likely provides shared testing utilities or configurations.
- `src/app/kiosks/services`: Contains the `KioskService`, which is used to provide data to the component.
- `src/app/kiosks/kiosk-product-layout/kiosk-product-layout.component.ts`: The actual component being tested.
- `src/app/kiosks/kiosk-product-layout-element-list/kiosk-product-layout-element-list.component.ts`: A child component that is part of the layout.

## Usage Examples
To run the tests defined in this file, you can use the Angular CLI command:
```bash
ng test
```
This will execute all tests in the project, including those in this spec file.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that all dependencies are properly mocked to isolate the component being tested.
- Keep tests focused on a single aspect of the component's functionality to make debugging easier.
- Regularly update tests as the component's functionality evolves to ensure they remain relevant and useful.
