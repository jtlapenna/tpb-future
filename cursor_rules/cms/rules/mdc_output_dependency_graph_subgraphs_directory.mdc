# Dependency Graph Subgraphs

## Overview
The `dependency_graph_subgraphs` directory contains generated HTML files that represent subgraphs of dependencies within the codebase. This visualization aids developers in understanding the relationships and hierarchies between various components of the project.

## Key Files
- **index.html**: This is the main entry point for viewing the dependency subgraphs. It provides an interactive visualization of the dependencies, allowing users to explore the structure and connections between different modules.

## Relation to Other Parts of the Codebase
This directory is part of the broader dependency analysis tools within the codebase. It does not import from or export to any other files, making it a standalone output directory. The data visualized in this directory is typically generated from analysis scripts that parse the codebase to identify dependencies.

## Common Patterns and Conventions
- The files in this directory are generated automatically and should not be manually edited. 
- The naming convention for files is straightforward, with `index.html` serving as the primary file for access.

## Best Practices
- Always regenerate the files in this directory after making changes to the codebase that affect dependencies to ensure the visualizations are up-to-date.
- Use the visualizations in `index.html` to facilitate discussions about code structure and dependencies during team meetings or code reviews.
- Keep the directory clean by avoiding unnecessary files; only the generated output should reside here.
