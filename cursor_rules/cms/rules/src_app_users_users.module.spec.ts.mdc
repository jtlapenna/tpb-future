# UsersModule Test Suite

## Overview
The `users.module.spec.ts` file contains unit tests for the `UsersModule` class, ensuring that it is instantiated correctly. This file is part of the testing suite for the user management feature of the application.

## Key Components
- **UsersModule**: This is the main class being tested. It is expected to be instantiated without any issues.
- **describe**: A Jest function that groups related tests. In this case, it groups tests related to the `UsersModule`.
- **beforeEach**: A Jest lifecycle method that runs before each test, ensuring a fresh instance of `UsersModule` is created for each test.
- **it**: A Jest function that defines a single test case. Here, it checks if the `UsersModule` instance is created successfully.

## File Relationships
This test file imports the `UsersModule` from `src/app/users/users.module.ts`. It does not have any other dependencies and is not imported by any other files in the repository. This indicates that it is a standalone test file focused solely on the `UsersModule`.

## Usage Example
To run the tests defined in this file, you can use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm test src/app/users/users.module.spec.ts
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `UsersModule` class is properly defined and exported in `users.module.ts` before running these tests.
- Keep the tests focused and concise, testing only one aspect of the `UsersModule` at a time.
- Regularly run the tests to catch any issues early in the development process.
- Update the tests if the `UsersModule` class undergoes significant changes to maintain accuracy.
