# ProductsPaginator Documentation

## Overview
The `ProductsPaginator` class is a specialized paginator that extends the functionality of the `AutocompletePaginator`. It is designed to manage pagination for product listings, allowing for efficient data retrieval and display in applications that require product selection or browsing.

## Key Components
### Class: ProductsPaginator
- **Constructor**: The constructor takes in a `ProductService`, a `paginationSize`, and an optional `filterBy` parameter. It initializes the paginator with the provided service and settings.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `service`: An instance of `ProductService` that provides methods to fetch product data.
    - `paginationSize`: A number indicating how many items to display per page (default is 10).
    - `filterBy`: An optional parameter to filter the products based on certain criteria.

- **Method: getOptions()**: This method is currently defined but not implemented. It is intended to retrieve the options for pagination, which may include the current page, total items, and other relevant pagination data.

## Dependencies
The `ProductsPaginator` class relies on the following dependencies:
- **ProductService**: Imported from `src/app/products/services`, this service is responsible for handling product-related data operations.
- **CrudService**: Imported from `../services/crud.service`, this service may provide additional CRUD operations that can be utilized by the paginator.
- **AutocompletePaginator**: The base class from which `ProductsPaginator` inherits, located in `./autocomplete-paginator`. This class likely provides foundational pagination logic and methods.

## Usage Example
To use the `ProductsPaginator`, you would typically instantiate it with a `ProductService` and configure it as needed:
```typescript
const productService = new ProductService();
const paginator = new ProductsPaginator(productService, 20, 'category');
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `ProductService` is properly configured and provides the necessary methods for data retrieval.
- Implement the `getOptions()` method to return meaningful pagination data to enhance the usability of the paginator.
- Consider extending the functionality of the paginator by adding methods for sorting or filtering products based on user input.
- Keep the pagination size configurable to allow for flexibility in different contexts of use.
