# DashboardComponent Documentation

## Overview
The `DashboardComponent` is a core component of the Angular application, responsible for rendering the dashboard view. It serves as a container for various dashboard-related functionalities and UI elements.

## Key Components
- **Class: `DashboardComponent`**  
  This class is the main component that Angular uses to instantiate the dashboard. It does not currently contain any methods or properties, but it can be extended in the future to include functionality such as data fetching or event handling.

## Dependencies
- **Imports:**  
  This file does not import any other files from the repository, making it a standalone component.  
- **Exports:**  
  The `DashboardComponent` is imported by `src/app/dashboard/dashboard.module.ts`, which likely declares it as part of the module, allowing it to be used within the application.

## Usage Example
To use the `DashboardComponent`, ensure it is declared in the appropriate Angular module (e.g., `DashboardModule`). You can then include it in your application template as follows:
```html
<app-dashboard></app-dashboard>
```

## Best Practices
- **Component Structure:**  
  Keep the component lean by only including necessary logic and delegating complex functionalities to services or other components.  
- **Template Management:**  
  Ensure that the associated template file (`dashboard.template.html`) is well-structured and follows Angular's best practices for templates.
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  As the application grows, consider adding input properties or methods to the `DashboardComponent` to handle data and events effectively.
