# StoreCategoryComponent Spec

## Overview
This file contains unit tests for the `StoreCategoryComponent` in an Angular application. It uses Angular's testing utilities to create a test suite that verifies the component's creation and basic functionality.

## Key Components
- **Imports**: The file imports necessary testing utilities from Angular, the component under test, and a custom testing module.
- **describe**: This function defines a test suite for the `StoreCategoryComponent`.
- **beforeEach**: This function sets up the testing environment before each test runs. It configures the testing module, compiles components, and initializes the component instance.
- **it**: This function defines an individual test case that checks if the component is created successfully.

## Dependencies
- **StoreCategoryComponent**: The component being tested, located at `src/app/stores/store-category/store-category.component.ts`.
- **PeakTestingModule**: A custom testing module imported from `src/app/test`, which likely contains shared testing utilities or configurations.

This spec file is not imported by any other files in the repository, indicating it is solely for testing the `StoreCategoryComponent`.

## Usage Examples
To run the tests defined in this file, use the Angular CLI command:
```bash
ng test
```
This will execute all tests in the project, including those in this spec file.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that all components have corresponding spec files to maintain test coverage.
- Use descriptive test case names to clarify the purpose of each test.
- Keep tests isolated and focused on a single aspect of the component's functionality.
- Regularly run tests during development to catch issues early.
