# ArticleListComponent Test File

## Overview
This file contains unit tests for the `ArticleListComponent` in an Angular application. It utilizes Angular's testing utilities to ensure that the component is created successfully and behaves as expected.

## Key Components
- **Imports**: The file imports necessary testing utilities from Angular, the component under test, and a custom testing module.
- **describe**: A Jasmine function that groups related tests for the `ArticleListComponent`.
- **beforeEach**: Sets up the testing environment before each test runs. It configures the testing module, compiles components, and initializes the component instance.
- **it**: A Jasmine function that defines an individual test case, in this case, checking if the component is created successfully.

## Dependencies
- **ArticleListComponent**: The component being tested, located at `src/app/articles/article-list/article-list.component.ts`. This component is responsible for displaying a list of articles.
- **PeakTestingModule**: A custom testing module imported from `src/app/test`, which likely includes shared testing utilities or mock services.
- **CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA**: This schema allows the use of custom elements in the component without Angular throwing errors about unknown elements.

## Usage Examples
To run the tests defined in this file, use the Angular CLI command:
```bash
ng test
```
This will execute all tests in the project, including those in this file.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that all components have corresponding test files to maintain code quality and reliability.
- Use descriptive test names to clarify the purpose of each test case.
- Keep tests isolated and focused on a single behavior to make debugging easier.
- Regularly run tests during development to catch issues early.
