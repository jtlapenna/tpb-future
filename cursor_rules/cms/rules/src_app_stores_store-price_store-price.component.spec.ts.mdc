# CatalogPriceComponent Spec Documentation

## Overview
This file contains the unit tests for the `CatalogPriceComponent`, which is part of the store price feature in the Angular application. It utilizes Angular's testing utilities to ensure that the component is created successfully and behaves as expected.

## Key Components
- **Imports**: The file imports necessary testing utilities from Angular, the component under test, and a custom testing module.
- **describe**: A Jasmine function that groups related tests for the `CatalogPriceComponent`.
- **beforeEach**: Sets up the testing environment before each test runs. It configures the testing module and creates an instance of the component.
- **it**: A Jasmine function that defines a single test case, checking if the component is created successfully.

## Dependencies
- **CatalogPriceComponent**: The main component being tested, located in `src/app/stores/store-price/store-price.component.ts`.
- **PeakTestingModule**: A custom testing module imported from `src/app/test`, which likely includes shared testing utilities or mock services.
- **CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA**: Used to ignore unknown elements in the component template, allowing for easier testing without needing to declare every custom element.

## Usage Example
To run the tests defined in this file, use the Angular CLI command:
```bash
ng test
```
This will execute all tests in the project, including those in this spec file.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that all components have corresponding spec files to maintain test coverage.
- Use `beforeEach` to set up common test scenarios to avoid code duplication.
- Keep tests isolated and focused on a single behavior to make debugging easier.
- Regularly run tests during development to catch issues early.
