# Overview
The `.firebaserc` file is a configuration file used by Firebase CLI to manage project settings for Firebase applications. It specifies the default Firebase project that the CLI should use when executing commands.

# Key Components
- **projects**: This section contains the project settings. In this case, it defines a single project under the key `default`.
  - **default**: The name of the Firebase project that is set as the default for the Firebase CLI commands. In this example, it is set to `tpb-cms-aim`.

# Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a configuration file specifically for Firebase CLI usage.

# Usage
To use this file, ensure that the Firebase CLI is installed and configured on your local machine. You can run Firebase commands such as `firebase deploy` or `firebase serve`, and the CLI will reference the project specified in this file.

# Best Practices
- Always ensure that the project name specified in the `.firebaserc` file matches the project name in your Firebase console to avoid deployment issues.
- Keep this file in version control to maintain consistent project settings across different environments and team members.
- If you have multiple Firebase projects, consider using different `.firebaserc` files for each project to avoid confusion.
