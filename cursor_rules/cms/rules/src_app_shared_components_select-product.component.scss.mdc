# Select Product Component Styles

## Overview
The `select-product.component.scss` file contains the styling rules for the select product component used within the shared components library of the application. This file is responsible for defining the visual appearance of the form control that allows users to select a product.

## Key Components
- **.form-control**: This class styles the main form control element. It sets the padding to `0` and removes the border to create a clean and minimalistic look.
  - **label**: Nested within the `.form-control`, this selector targets the label associated with the form control. It sets the margin-bottom to `0px`, ensuring that there is no extra space below the label, which helps in maintaining a compact layout.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other styles or files from the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone, providing specific styles for the select product component without external dependencies.

## Usage Examples
To use the styles defined in this file, ensure that the `form-control` class is applied to the relevant HTML elements in the select product component. For example:
```html
<div class="form-control">
  <label for="product-select">Select a Product:</label>
  <select id="product-select">
    <option value="product1">Product 1</option>
    <option value="product2">Product 2</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the styles defined in this file are only applied to the intended components to avoid unintended styling conflicts.
- When modifying styles, consider the overall design consistency of the application to maintain a cohesive user experience.
- Keep the styles minimal and focused on functionality, as this file is intended to provide a clean interface for product selection.
