# src/api/urls.js Documentation

## Overview
This file defines constants that represent the endpoints used in the API for handling order-related operations. These constants help maintain consistency and avoid hardcoding strings throughout the codebase.

## Key Components
- **ORDERS_PREVIEW**: A constant string that holds the URL path for previewing an order. This is used in API requests to fetch order preview data.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files, but it is imported by `src/api/api.js`. This indicates that the constants defined here are utilized in the API logic to construct requests to the server.

## Usage Example
In `src/api/api.js`, you might see the following usage:
```javascript
import { ORDERS_PREVIEW } from './urls';

function fetchOrderPreview(orderId) {
    return fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/${ORDERS_PREVIEW}/${orderId}`);
}
```
This example shows how the `ORDERS_PREVIEW` constant is used to build a complete URL for fetching an order preview based on an `orderId`.

## Best Practices
- Always use the defined constants instead of hardcoding URL strings in your API calls. This ensures that if the endpoint changes, you only need to update it in one place.
- Keep the naming of constants clear and descriptive to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- Consider adding comments for any new constants added in the future to explain their purpose.
