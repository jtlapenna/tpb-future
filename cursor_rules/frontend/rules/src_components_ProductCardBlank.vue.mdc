# ProductCardBlank.vue Documentation

## Overview
The `ProductCardBlank` component is a Vue.js single-file component that represents a blank product card, typically used to indicate that a product is out of stock. It provides a visual placeholder with customizable layout options and styles, making it suitable for various display contexts, including shared screens and split screens.

## Key Components
- **Template**: The template section defines the structure of the product card, including:
  - A main `div` that binds classes based on props like `layout`, `sharedScreenConfig`, and `isForSplitScreen`.
  - An icon placeholder that adjusts its size based on the `isForSplitScreen` prop.
  - A message indicating that the product is out of stock.
  - An optional `div` that displays the `indexOrder` if provided.

- **Script**: The script section exports the component with the following props:
  - `layout`: A string that determines the layout style of the card.
  - `sharedScreenConfig`: A boolean that indicates if the card is displayed in a shared screen context.
  - `isForSplitScreen`: A boolean that indicates if the card is displayed in a split-screen layout.
  - `cardZise`: A number that defines the size of the card.
  - `product`: An object representing the product (not used in this blank state).
  - `indexOrder`: A number that can be used to display the order index of the product.

- **Styles**: The styles are scoped to the component and include:
  - Flexbox layout for centering content.
  - Specific styles for the out-of-stock message and icon.
  - Responsive design adjustments based on the `cardZise` prop.

## Dependencies
This component does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It is a standalone component designed for use within a larger product listing or catalog.

## Usage Example
To use the `ProductCardBlank` component, you can include it in a parent component as follows:
```vue
<ProductCardBlank 
  layout="full" 
  sharedScreenConfig="true" 
  isForSplitScreen="false" 
  cardZise="2" 
  indexOrder="1" 
/> 
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `layout` prop is set appropriately to maintain consistent styling across different contexts.
- Use the `indexOrder` prop to provide context when displaying multiple product cards, especially in lists or grids.
- Keep the component's props minimal and relevant to maintain clarity and ease of use.
- Regularly review the styles to ensure they align with the overall design system of the application.
