# RFIDLocal.js Documentation

## Overview
The `RFIDLocal` class is a specialized implementation of the `LocalRepo` class, designed to manage RFID records in a local repository. It extends the functionality of `LocalRepo` by specifying the collection name and the unique identifier for the records.

## Key Components
- **Class: `RFIDLocal`**  
  This class inherits from `LocalRepo` and is initialized with specific parameters that define the collection name as 'rfids' and the unique identifier field as 'id'.  
  - **Constructor**:  
    - **Parameters**: None  
    - **Functionality**: Calls the parent constructor with 'rfids' and 'id' to set up the local repository for RFID records.

## Dependencies
- **Imports**:  
  - `LocalRepo`: This is the base class from which `RFIDLocal` inherits. It provides the foundational methods and properties for managing local data repositories.
- **Exports**:  
  - This file is imported by `src/api/rfid/RFIDRepo.js`, which likely utilizes the `RFIDLocal` class to interact with RFID data.

## Usage Example
To use the `RFIDLocal` class, you can instantiate it as follows:
```javascript
import { RFIDLocal } from './RFIDLocal';

const rfidRepo = new RFIDLocal();
// Now you can use rfidRepo to manage RFID records.
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `LocalRepo` class is properly implemented and tested, as `RFIDLocal` relies on its functionality.
- When extending the `LocalRepo`, consider overriding methods if specific behavior is needed for RFID records.
- Keep the collection name and identifier consistent with the rest of the application to avoid confusion.
- Document any additional methods or properties added to `RFIDLocal` to maintain clarity in the codebase.
