# FeatureTagsLocal.js Documentation

## Overview
The `FeatureTagsLocal` class is a specialized implementation of the `LocalRepo` class, designed to manage local storage and retrieval of feature tags within the application. It serves as a data repository that interacts with the local data layer, specifically targeting the 'tags' entity identified by 'id'.

## Key Components
- **Class: `FeatureTagsLocal`**  
  This class extends the `LocalRepo` class, inheriting its methods and properties. The constructor initializes the repository with specific parameters:
  - **Entity Name:** 'tags'  
  - **Identifier:** 'id'  

## Dependencies
- **Imports:**  
  - `LocalRepo` from `../LocalRepo`: This is the base class that provides the foundational functionality for local data management.

- **Exports:**  
  - This file is imported by `src/api/feature-tags/FeatureTagsRepo.js`, which likely utilizes the `FeatureTagsLocal` class to handle feature tags in a more complex manner.

## Usage Example
To use the `FeatureTagsLocal` class, you would typically instantiate it and call its methods to interact with the local storage of feature tags. Hereâ€™s a simple example:
```javascript
import { FeatureTagsLocal } from './FeatureTagsLocal';

const featureTagsRepo = new FeatureTagsLocal();
// Now you can use featureTagsRepo to manage feature tags locally.
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that you understand the structure and methods provided by the `LocalRepo` class, as `FeatureTagsLocal` relies heavily on its functionality.
- When extending or modifying this class, maintain the integrity of the entity name and identifier to avoid breaking changes in the data management logic.
- Consider implementing error handling when interacting with local storage to manage potential issues gracefully.
