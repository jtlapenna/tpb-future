# Overview
The `.firebaserc` file is a configuration file used by Firebase to manage project settings and hosting targets. It defines the Firebase projects associated with the codebase and specifies the hosting configurations for different environments.

# Key Components
- **projects**: This section maps environment names to Firebase project identifiers. In this case, the `staging` environment is linked to the project `tpb-kiosk-fe-vue`.
- **targets**: This section defines the hosting targets for the specified Firebase project. Each target corresponds to a specific deployment configuration for hosting services.
  - **purchase-limit**: Target for the purchase limit feature.
  - **tpb-product-limit**: Target for the product limit feature.
  - **jarupa**: Target for the Jarupa service.
  - **treez**: Target for the Treez service.
  - **heacock**: Target for the Heacock service.
  - **empireconnect**: Target for the Empire Connect service.
  - **test-shopify**: Target for testing Shopify integration.

# Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It serves as a standalone configuration file for Firebase.

# Usage Examples
To deploy to a specific target, you can use Firebase CLI commands. For example, to deploy the `purchase-limit` target, you would run:
```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting:purchase-limit
```

# Best Practices
- Ensure that the project identifiers in the `projects` section are correctly set up in the Firebase console.
- Regularly review and update the hosting targets to reflect any changes in your application structure or deployment needs.
- Use descriptive names for your targets to make it easier for team members to understand their purpose.
