# CategoriesRemote.js Documentation

## Overview
The `CategoriesRemote.js` file defines the `CategoriesRemote` class, which extends the `RemoteRepo` class. This class is responsible for handling remote operations related to categories in the application, providing a structured way to interact with category data from a remote source.

## Key Components
### CategoriesRemote Class
- **Constructor**: The constructor calls the parent class `RemoteRepo` with the string 'categories', indicating that this instance will manage remote operations specifically for categories.

```javascript
export class CategoriesRemote extends RemoteRepo {
  constructor () {
    super('categories')
  }
}
```

## Dependencies
- **Imports**: This file imports the `RemoteRepo` class from `src/api/RemoteRepo.js`, which provides the foundational methods for remote data handling.
- **Exports**: The `CategoriesRemote` class is utilized in `src/api/categories/CategoriesRepo.js`, where it likely serves as a data source for category-related operations.

## Usage Example
To use the `CategoriesRemote` class, you would typically instantiate it in another module where category data needs to be fetched or manipulated:

```javascript
import { CategoriesRemote } from './CategoriesRemote';

const categoriesRemote = new CategoriesRemote();
// Now you can use categoriesRemote to perform operations related to categories.
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that any methods added to the `CategoriesRemote` class adhere to the conventions established in the `RemoteRepo` class to maintain consistency across remote data handling.
- When extending functionality, consider the implications on existing methods and ensure backward compatibility where necessary.
- Document any new methods or changes made to this class to keep the codebase maintainable and understandable for future developers.
