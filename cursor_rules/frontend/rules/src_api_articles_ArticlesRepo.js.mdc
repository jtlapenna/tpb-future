# ArticlesRepo.js Documentation

## Overview
The `ArticlesRepo` class serves as a repository for managing articles in the application. It acts as an intermediary between the local and remote data sources, allowing for seamless data retrieval and storage.

## Key Components
- **ArticlesRepo Class**: Inherits from the `Repo` class and is initialized with instances of `ArticlesRemote` and `ArticlesLocal`. This setup allows the `ArticlesRepo` to fetch articles from both remote and local sources.

### Constructor
- **constructor()**: Calls the parent constructor with the remote and local article sources and a string identifier for the articles. This establishes the necessary connections to the data sources.

## Dependencies
- **ArticlesLocal**: This module handles local storage and retrieval of articles.
- **ArticlesRemote**: This module manages the fetching of articles from a remote server.
- **Repo**: The base class that provides common repository functionalities, which `ArticlesRepo` extends.

## Usage Example
To use the `ArticlesRepo`, you can import it in your application as follows:
```javascript
import articlesRepo from './ArticlesRepo';

// Example usage
articlesRepo.fetchAll().then(articles => {
  console.log(articles);
});
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that both `ArticlesLocal` and `ArticlesRemote` are properly implemented to avoid issues with data retrieval.
- When extending the `Repo` class, make sure to adhere to the expected interface and functionality to maintain consistency across different repositories.
- Consider implementing error handling when fetching data from remote sources to enhance the robustness of your application.
