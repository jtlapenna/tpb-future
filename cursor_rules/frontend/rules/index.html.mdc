# index.html Documentation

## Overview
The `index.html` file serves as the main entry point for the tpb-kiosk web application. It sets up the basic structure of the HTML document and includes essential metadata, styles, and scripts necessary for the application to function properly.

## Key Components
- **DOCTYPE Declaration**: The file begins with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, which defines the document type and version of HTML being used.
- **Head Section**:  
  - **Meta Tags**: The `<meta>` tags specify the character set as UTF-8 and set the viewport for responsive design.
  - **Title**: The `<title>` tag sets the title of the web page as "tpb-kiosk".
  - **Scripts**: A script is included to load configuration settings from `config.js`. There are commented-out script tags for additional functionality that may be included later, such as `upload.js` and the Dexie library for IndexedDB.
  - **Stylesheet**: A link to a custom CSS file (`custom.css`) is included to style the application.

- **Body Section**:  
  - The body contains a main `<div>` with an ID of `app`, which houses two child `<div>` elements: `output` and `restart-timer`. These elements are placeholders for dynamic content that will be injected by JavaScript during runtime.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as the primary HTML document for the application.

## Usage Examples
While this file does not contain any executable code, it is essential for rendering the application in a web browser. Developers should ensure that the linked JavaScript and CSS files are correctly implemented to achieve the desired functionality and styling.

## Best Practices
- **Maintain Clean Structure**: Keep the HTML structure clean and organized for better readability and maintainability.
- **Commenting**: Use comments to indicate sections of the code, especially for scripts that are temporarily disabled or under consideration for future use.
- **Responsive Design**: Always test the application on various devices to ensure that the viewport settings are functioning as intended.
- **Version Control**: When making changes to this file, consider versioning the linked scripts and styles to avoid caching issues in browsers.
