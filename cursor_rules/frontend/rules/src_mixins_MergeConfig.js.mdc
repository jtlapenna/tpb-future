# MergeConfig.js Documentation

## Overview
The `MergeConfig.js` file defines a simple utility function called `mergeConfig`. This function is intended to handle configuration merging, although its current implementation returns an empty object. This file serves as a mixin that can be utilized in various parts of the application where configuration management is necessary.

## Key Components
### mergeConfig
- **Function Signature**: `const mergeConfig = (config) => { return {}; }`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `config`: The configuration object that is intended to be merged. 
- **Returns**: An empty object. 

Currently, the function does not perform any merging logic, but it is designed to be expanded in the future to accommodate configuration merging functionality.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone, which may indicate that it is either a work in progress or a foundational piece intended for future development.

## Usage Examples
While the function is not yet implemented, it can be used as follows once the merging logic is added:
```javascript
import mergeConfig from './MergeConfig';

const userConfig = { theme: 'dark' };
const defaultConfig = { theme: 'light', language: 'en' };

const finalConfig = mergeConfig(defaultConfig, userConfig);
console.log(finalConfig); // Expected output: { theme: 'dark', language: 'en' }
```

## Best Practices
- **Future Implementation**: When implementing the merging logic, consider using deep merging techniques to ensure nested objects are handled correctly.
- **Documentation**: Keep the documentation updated as the function evolves to ensure clarity for future developers.
- **Testing**: Write unit tests to cover various scenarios of configuration merging to ensure reliability and correctness of the function's behavior.
