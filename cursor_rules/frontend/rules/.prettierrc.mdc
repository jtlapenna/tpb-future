# Overview
The `.prettierrc` file is a configuration file for Prettier, a popular code formatting tool. This file defines the formatting rules that Prettier will apply to the codebase, ensuring consistent style across the project.

# Key Components
- **singleQuote**: This option, when set to `true`, enforces the use of single quotes for strings instead of double quotes. This is a stylistic choice that can help maintain consistency in string formatting throughout the codebase.
- **semi**: This option, when set to `false`, disables the automatic insertion of semicolons at the end of statements. This can lead to a cleaner look in some coding styles, particularly in JavaScript.

# Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a configuration file that Prettier reads when formatting code.

# Usage Examples
To use this configuration, simply ensure that Prettier is installed in your project. You can run Prettier from the command line or integrate it into your development environment. For example:
```bash
npx prettier --write .
```
This command will format all files in the current directory according to the rules specified in `.prettierrc`.

# Best Practices
- **Consistency**: Always use the same configuration across your team to avoid style discrepancies. Consider adding the `.prettierrc` file to version control.
- **Integration**: Integrate Prettier with your code editor to automatically format code on save. This helps maintain code quality and reduces the need for manual formatting.
- **Review Changes**: When making changes to the `.prettierrc` file, review the impact on the codebase by checking the diffs in version control to ensure that the new formatting rules align with team preferences.
