# TPB Frontend Setup Documentation

## Overview
This README file provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the TPB frontend application. It guides users through cloning the repository, configuring necessary settings, installing dependencies, and starting the application.

## Key Components
- **Clone the Repository:** Instructions to download the project code from the repository using Git.
- **Update Configuration:** Details on how to modify the `config.js` file to set the API URL, catalog ID, and authentication token required for the application to function correctly.
- **Install Docker Compose:** A prerequisite step to ensure that Docker Compose is installed for managing application containers.
- **Start the Application:** Commands to launch the application using Docker Compose.
- **Access the Frontend:** Instructions on how to access the running application via a web browser.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It serves as a standalone guide for setting up the frontend application.

## Usage Example
To set up the TPB frontend, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-folder>
   ```
2. Update the `config.js` file with your specific settings:
   ```js
   URL: "http://localhost:3000/api/v1",
   CATALOG_ID: 1,
   TOKEN: "your-generated-token-here",
   ```
3. Install Docker Compose and start the application:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Access the frontend at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Best Practices
- Always ensure that your configuration values in `config.js` are correct before starting the application to avoid runtime errors.
- Use the provided staging and production URLs appropriately to test your application in different environments.
- Keep your Docker and Docker Compose installations up to date to leverage the latest features and security updates.
