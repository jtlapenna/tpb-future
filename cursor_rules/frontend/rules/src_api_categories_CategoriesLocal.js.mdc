# CategoriesLocal.js Documentation

## Overview
The `CategoriesLocal` class is a part of the local data management layer for categories in the application. It extends the `LocalRepo` class, providing a structured way to interact with category data stored locally.

## Purpose and Functionality
The primary purpose of the `CategoriesLocal` class is to facilitate CRUD operations on category data. By extending `LocalRepo`, it inherits methods for data manipulation while specifying the context for categories, identified by the `id` field.

## Key Components
- **CategoriesLocal Class**: This class is defined to manage category data. It calls the constructor of `LocalRepo` with specific parameters:
  - `categories`: This is the name of the data type being managed.
  - `id`: This is the unique identifier for each category.

## Dependencies
- **Imports**: This file imports the `LocalRepo` class from `src/api/LocalRepo.js`, which provides the foundational methods for data handling.
- **Exports**: The `CategoriesLocal` class is utilized in `src/api/categories/CategoriesRepo.js`, indicating that it plays a role in the broader category management system.

## Usage Example
To use the `CategoriesLocal` class, you would typically instantiate it and call its methods to perform operations on category data:
```javascript
import { CategoriesLocal } from './CategoriesLocal';

const categoriesRepo = new CategoriesLocal();
// Now you can use categoriesRepo to manage category data.
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `id` field is unique for each category to prevent data conflicts.
- When extending functionality, consider the implications on the inherited methods from `LocalRepo` to maintain data integrity.
- Keep the data structure consistent with the expected format in other parts of the application to avoid runtime errors.
