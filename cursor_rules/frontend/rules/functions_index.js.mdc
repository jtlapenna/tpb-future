# Functions Index File Documentation

## Overview
This file contains Firebase Cloud Functions that are triggered via HTTP requests. It primarily handles sending messages to a Firestore database based on incoming requests.

## Key Components

### 1. Firebase Functions
The file imports the Firebase Functions SDK to define and manage cloud functions. The main function exported is `sendMessage`, which processes incoming HTTP requests.

### 2. Firebase Admin SDK
The Firebase Admin SDK is used to interact with Firestore, allowing the function to create new documents in the database.

### 3. `sendMessage` Function
- **Purpose**: This function is triggered by an HTTP request and is responsible for adding a new message to a Firestore collection.
- **Parameters**: It accepts a request (`req`) and a response (`res`) object.
- **Functionality**: It extracts the body of the request, logs it, and then adds the data to a Firestore collection based on the `catalog_id` provided in the request body. Finally, it sends a JSON response back to the client with a success message and the result of the Firestore operation.

### Example Usage
To use the `sendMessage` function, send an HTTP POST request to the endpoint where this function is deployed, including a JSON body with the required fields, such as `catalog_id` and any other relevant data.

Example request body:
```json
{
  "catalog_id": "12345",
  "order_id": "abcde",
  "other_data": "value"
}
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure that the request body contains all necessary fields before processing to avoid errors.
- Implement error handling for Firestore operations to manage potential failures gracefully.
- Use structured logging to help with debugging and monitoring the function's performance.

## Dependencies
This file does not import or export any other files in the repository, making it a standalone module for handling specific cloud function tasks.
