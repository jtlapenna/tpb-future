# Documentation Directory Overview

The `docs` directory serves as the central location for all documentation related to the project. It is designed to provide developers and users with comprehensive information about the API and its usage.

## Key Files

- **peak_api.md**: This file contains detailed documentation for the Peak API, outlining its endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples. It is essential for developers looking to integrate with or utilize the API effectively.

## Relation to Other Parts of the Codebase

The `docs` directory is independent of the codebase's functional components, as it does not import from or get imported by any other files. However, it plays a crucial role in enhancing the understanding of the codebase by providing necessary context and guidance for developers.

## Common Patterns and Conventions

- Documentation files should follow a consistent naming convention, ideally reflecting the functionality or component they describe.
- Markdown formatting should be used to ensure clarity and readability, including headers, lists, and code blocks where applicable.

## Best Practices

- Keep documentation up-to-date with any changes in the API or codebase to avoid confusion.
- Use clear and concise language to make the documentation accessible to both new and experienced developers.
- Regularly review and refactor documentation to improve clarity and organization, ensuring it remains relevant and useful.
