# PaymentGatewayProviderSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `PaymentGatewayProviderSerializer` class is a serializer that formats the output of payment gateway provider objects for API responses. It inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides a way to customize the JSON representation of the model.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `PaymentGatewayProviderSerializer`
  - **Attributes**: The serializer defines three attributes to be included in the serialized output:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the payment gateway provider.
    - `name`: The name of the payment gateway provider.
    - `fields`: Additional fields related to the payment gateway provider, which may include configuration options or settings.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone as a serializer for the payment gateway provider model.

## Usage Example
To use this serializer, you would typically call it within a controller action that responds with JSON. For example:
```ruby
render json: @payment_gateway_provider, serializer: PaymentGatewayProviderSerializer
```
This would return a JSON response containing the `id`, `name`, and `fields` of the specified payment gateway provider.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data structure of the underlying model.
- Keep the serializer focused on formatting the output without including business logic or data manipulation.
- Regularly review and update the serializer as the model evolves to ensure consistency in API responses.
