# StoreTaxSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `StoreTaxSerializer` class is a serializer that formats the output of store tax data for API responses. It inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides a way to customize the JSON representation of the model.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `StoreTaxSerializer`
  - **Attributes**: The serializer defines three attributes that will be included in the serialized output:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the store tax.
    - `name`: The name of the store tax.
    - `value`: The value of the store tax.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository and is not imported by any other files. It stands alone as a simple serializer for the store tax model.

## Usage Example
To use the `StoreTaxSerializer`, you would typically render a store tax object in a controller action like so:
```ruby
render json: @store_tax, serializer: StoreTaxSerializer
```
This will return a JSON response containing the `id`, `name`, and `value` of the `@store_tax` object.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer match the attributes available in the corresponding model.
- Keep the serializer focused on a single model to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- Use serializers to control the output format of your API responses, especially when dealing with nested or complex data structures.
