# LayoutPosition Model Documentation

## Overview
The `LayoutPosition` model represents a layout position in the application. It inherits from `ApplicationRecord`, which means it is a part of the Active Record framework in Ruby on Rails. This model is primarily responsible for managing layout position data in the database.

## Key Components
- **Class Definition**: `class LayoutPosition < ApplicationRecord`
  - This line defines the `LayoutPosition` class, which inherits from `ApplicationRecord`, allowing it to interact with the database.

- **Validations**: `validates :label, presence: true`
  - This validation ensures that the `label` attribute must be present before a `LayoutPosition` object can be saved to the database. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity.

## Schema Information
The `layout_positions` table in the database has the following schema:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each layout position (primary key).
- `label`: A string that represents the name or label of the layout position.
- `created_at`: A timestamp indicating when the record was created.
- `updated_at`: A timestamp indicating when the record was last updated.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a model definition.

## Usage Examples
To create a new layout position, you can use the following code:
```ruby
layout_position = LayoutPosition.new(label: 'Header')
if layout_position.save
  puts 'Layout position created successfully!'
else
  puts 'Error: ' + layout_position.errors.full_messages.join(', ')
end
```

## Best Practices
- Always ensure that the `label` attribute is provided when creating or updating a `LayoutPosition` instance to avoid validation errors.
- Consider adding additional validations or methods to enhance the functionality of the `LayoutPosition` model as the application grows.
- Keep the model focused on its responsibilities; avoid adding unrelated methods or logic that could complicate its purpose.
