# ProductMinimalSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `ProductMinimalSerializer` class is a serializer for the `Product` model, designed to provide a minimal representation of product data. It is part of the ActiveModel::Serializer framework, which is used to customize the JSON output of models in a Rails application.

## Key Components
- **Class Definition**: `ProductMinimalSerializer` inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, allowing it to define how the `Product` model should be serialized.
- **Attributes**: The `attributes` method specifies which fields of the `Product` model should be included in the serialized output. In this case, it includes `:id` and `:name`.
- **Associations**: The `belongs_to :category` line indicates that each product is associated with a category, and this relationship will be included in the serialized output.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone as a serializer for the `Product` model.

## Usage Example
When a `Product` object is serialized, the output will include only the `id` and `name` attributes, along with the associated `category`. For example:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Sample Product",
  "category": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Sample Category"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer are relevant to the API consumers. Avoid including unnecessary data to keep the response lightweight.
- When adding new attributes or associations, consider the impact on performance and the size of the serialized output.
- Keep the serializer focused on a single model to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
