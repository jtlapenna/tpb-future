# TagInfoPolicy Documentation

## Overview
The `TagInfoPolicy` class is a policy that defines the permitted attributes for the `TagInfo` model in the application. It inherits from `ApplicationPolicy`, which provides a base structure for defining authorization rules in the application.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `TagInfoPolicy`
  - Inherits from `ApplicationPolicy`, allowing it to leverage common authorization logic.

- **Method**: `permitted_attributes`
  - Returns an array of symbols representing the attributes that are permitted for mass assignment. In this case, it allows the `:tag` and `:description` attributes.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a policy definition for the `TagInfo` model.

## Usage Example
To use this policy in your application, you would typically call the `permitted_attributes` method when creating or updating a `TagInfo` object. For example:
```ruby
# In a controller action
@tag_info = TagInfo.new(tag_info_policy.permitted_attributes)
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in `permitted_attributes` are the only ones that should be mass-assignable to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- Regularly review and update the permitted attributes as the application evolves to ensure they remain relevant and secure.
- Use descriptive names for attributes to maintain clarity in the policy's purpose.
