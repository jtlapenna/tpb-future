# StoreCategoryTaxSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `StoreCategoryTaxSerializer` class is a serializer that formats the `StoreCategoryTax` model's attributes for JSON representation. It is part of the ActiveModel::Serializer framework, which is used to create a structured JSON response for API endpoints.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `StoreCategoryTaxSerializer`
  - Inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to serialize model objects.
  - **Attributes**: The serializer defines three attributes to be included in the serialized output:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the store category tax.
    - `name`: The name of the store category tax.
    - `value`: The value associated with the store category tax.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It stands alone as a serializer for the `StoreCategoryTax` model.

## Usage Example
To use this serializer, you would typically render a JSON response in a controller action. For example:
```ruby
render json: @store_category_tax, serializer: StoreCategoryTaxSerializer
```
This would return a JSON object containing the `id`, `name`, and `value` of the `StoreCategoryTax` instance.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer match the attributes available in the `StoreCategoryTax` model.
- Keep the serializer focused on a single model to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- Use serializers to control the output of your API, ensuring that only the necessary data is exposed to clients.
