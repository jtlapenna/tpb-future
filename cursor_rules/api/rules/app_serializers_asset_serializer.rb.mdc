# AssetSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `AssetSerializer` class is a part of the ActiveModel Serializers framework, which is used to serialize Ruby objects into JSON format. This specific serializer is designed to handle the serialization of asset objects, providing a structured representation of their attributes.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `AssetSerializer`
  - Inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to convert Ruby objects into JSON.
  - **Attributes**: The serializer defines two attributes that will be included in the serialized output:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the asset.
    - `url`: The URL pointing to the asset's location.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a simple serializer for asset objects.

## Usage Example
To use the `AssetSerializer`, you would typically instantiate it with an asset object and render it in a controller action. For example:
```ruby
class AssetsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    asset = Asset.find(params[:id])
    render json: AssetSerializer.new(asset)
  end
end
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data you want to expose through the API.
- Keep the serializer focused on a single model to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- Regularly review and update the serializer as the underlying model changes to ensure consistency in the API response.
