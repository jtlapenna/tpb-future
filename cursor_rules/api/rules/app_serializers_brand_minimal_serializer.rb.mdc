# BrandMinimalSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `BrandMinimalSerializer` class is a serializer that defines how brand objects are represented in JSON format. It is part of the ActiveModel::Serializer framework, which is used to create a structured representation of models for APIs.

## Key Components
- **Class:** `BrandMinimalSerializer`
  - **Inherits from:** `ActiveModel::Serializer`
  - **Attributes:** The serializer specifies two attributes to be included in the serialized output:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the brand.
    - `name`: The name of the brand.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a simple serializer for brand objects.

## Usage Example
To use the `BrandMinimalSerializer`, you would typically render a brand object in a controller action like so:
```ruby
render json: @brand, serializer: BrandMinimalSerializer
```
This would return a JSON response containing only the `id` and `name` of the brand.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer are relevant to the API consumers. Avoid including unnecessary data to keep the response lightweight.
- If additional attributes are needed in the future, consider creating a new serializer or extending this one to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- Regularly review the serializers as the application evolves to ensure they still meet the needs of the API consumers.
