# AdBannerSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `AdBannerSerializer` class is part of the API version 1 (V1) module and is responsible for serializing the `AdBanner` model into a JSON format that can be easily consumed by clients. This serializer defines which attributes of the `AdBanner` model should be included in the JSON response.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `AdBannerSerializer`
  - Inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides a framework for serializing Ruby objects into JSON.
  - **Attributes**: The following attributes are defined for serialization:
    - `id`: The unique identifier for the ad banner.
    - `ad_banner_location`: The location where the ad banner is displayed.
    - `ad_banner_location_id`: The identifier for the ad banner's location.
    - `text`: The text content of the ad banner.
    - `images`: The images associated with the ad banner.
    - `callback_url`: A URL for callbacks related to the ad banner.
    - `disabled`: A boolean indicating if the ad banner is disabled.
    - `advertisable`: The associated advertisable object.
    - `advertisable_id`: The ID of the associated advertisable object.
    - `advertisable_type`: The type of the associated advertisable object.
    - `advertisable_image`: The image associated with the advertisable object.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files and is not imported by any other files in the repository. It operates independently within the context of the API V1 module.

## Usage Examples
To use the `AdBannerSerializer`, you would typically instantiate it with an `AdBanner` object and render it in a controller action. For example:
```ruby
render json: AdBannerSerializer.new(ad_banner)
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data structure of the `AdBanner` model.
- Keep the serializer focused on the specific attributes needed for the API response to avoid over-fetching data.
- Regularly review and update the serializer as the `AdBanner` model evolves to maintain consistency in the API responses.
