# StoreSyncSerializer Documentation

## Overview
The `StoreSyncSerializer` class is a serializer that is part of the ActiveModel::Serializer framework. It is designed to format the JSON output for the `StoreSync` model, specifically focusing on the attributes and relationships that need to be included in the serialized output.

## Key Components
- **Class Definition**: `class StoreSyncSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer`
  - This line defines the `StoreSyncSerializer` class, which inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, allowing it to utilize the serialization features provided by the ActiveModel framework.

- **Attributes**: `attributes :id`
  - This line specifies that the serialized output will include the `id` attribute of the `StoreSync` model. This is essential for identifying the resource uniquely in the API responses.

- **Relationships**: `has_many :store_sync_items`
  - This line establishes a one-to-many relationship with the `store_sync_items`. It indicates that a `StoreSync` can have multiple associated `StoreSyncItem` records, which will also be serialized when the `StoreSync` is rendered.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a serializer for the `StoreSync` model.

## Usage Examples
When a `StoreSync` object is rendered in a JSON response, the `StoreSyncSerializer` will format the output to include the `id` and the associated `store_sync_items`. For example:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "store_sync_items": [
    {"item_id": 1, "quantity": 10},
    {"item_id": 2, "quantity": 5}
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer accurately reflect the data needed by the client applications.
- Keep the serializer lightweight by only including necessary attributes and relationships to optimize performance.
- Regularly review and update the serializer as the underlying model changes to maintain consistency in the API responses.
