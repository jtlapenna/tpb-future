# ProductLayoutValueSerializer

## Overview
The `ProductLayoutValueSerializer` is a serializer class that defines how the `ProductLayoutValue` model is represented in JSON format. It is part of the ActiveModel::Serializer framework, which is used to create a structured and consistent API response.

## Key Components
- **Class Definition**: The class `ProductLayoutValueSerializer` inherits from `ActiveModel::Serializer`, which provides the necessary functionality to serialize the model.
- **Attributes**: The `attributes` method specifies which attributes of the `ProductLayoutValue` model should be included in the serialized output. In this case, the following attributes are included:
  - `id`: The unique identifier for the product layout value.
  - `link`: A URL or reference link associated with the product layout value.
  - `content`: The content or description of the product layout value.
  - `product_layout_element_id`: The identifier for the associated product layout element.
- **Associations**: The `has_one :asset` line indicates that each `ProductLayoutValue` can be associated with one `asset`, which will also be serialized when the `ProductLayoutValue` is serialized.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a serializer for the `ProductLayoutValue` model.

## Usage Examples
To use this serializer, you would typically call it when rendering a `ProductLayoutValue` object in a controller action. For example:
```ruby
render json: @product_layout_value, serializer: ProductLayoutValueSerializer
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the attributes defined in the serializer match the attributes available in the `ProductLayoutValue` model.
- Keep the serializer focused on the specific model it represents to maintain clarity and separation of concerns.
- When adding new attributes or associations, consider the impact on the API response and ensure that they are necessary for the client consuming the API.
