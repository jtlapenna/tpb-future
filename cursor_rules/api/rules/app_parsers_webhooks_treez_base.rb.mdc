# Webhooks::Treez::Base Documentation

## Overview
The `Webhooks::Treez::Base` class serves as a foundational component for handling webhook payloads from the Treez service. It encapsulates the store and payload data necessary for processing incoming webhook requests.

## Key Components
- **Class**: `Webhooks::Treez::Base`
  - **Attributes**:
    - `store`: An instance variable that holds the store object associated with the webhook.
    - `payload`: An instance variable that contains the data payload received from the webhook.
  - **Method**:
    - `initialize(store, payload)`: Constructor method that initializes the `store` and `payload` attributes with the provided arguments.

## Dependencies
This file does not import any other files in the repository, nor is it imported by any other files. It stands alone as a simple class definition.

## Usage Example
To create an instance of the `Webhooks::Treez::Base` class, you would do the following:
```ruby
store = SomeStoreClass.new
payload = { key: 'value' }
webhook = Webhooks::Treez::Base.new(store, payload)
```

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `store` and `payload` passed to the constructor are valid and properly formatted to avoid runtime errors.
- Consider extending this class with additional methods for processing the payload, as this class currently only serves as a data holder.
- Keep the class focused on its primary responsibility to maintain clarity and ease of use.
