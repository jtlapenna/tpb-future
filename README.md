# The Peak Beyond (TPB) Future Project

## üéØ **PROJECT STATUS: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

**Current Phase**: V2 Foundation Development  
**Primary Focus**: Modernizing e-commerce project for V2 spine  
**Next Milestone**: Complete e-commerce modernization (3 months)  
**Team**: Active collaboration with development team  

## Project Overview

This repository contains The Peak Beyond's comprehensive ecosystem of in-store hardware and software products, strategic planning documents, and analysis artifacts. The project encompasses legacy systems, future planning, and modern e-commerce extensions designed to position TPB as a leader in cannabis retail technology and the emerging AI agent economy.

## üöÄ **CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**

**DECISION MADE**: We are using the **TPB-Ecomm-FE-and-BE** project as our foundation for V2 development, NOT rebuilding from the legacy Vue.js system.

### **üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: DEPENDENCY MODERNIZATION**

**CRITICAL**: The e-commerce project has severely outdated dependencies that must be updated before any feature development:

- **React**: 17.0.2 ‚Üí **18.x** (Major version behind)
- **TypeScript**: 4.3.5 ‚Üí **5.x** (Major version behind)  
- **Material-UI**: v4.12.3 ‚Üí **v5 (MUI)** (Major version behind)
- **NestJS**: 8.0.0 ‚Üí **10.x** (Major version behind)
- **Node.js**: 14 ‚Üí **18+** (Major security risk)
- **Create React App**: 4.0.3 ‚Üí **Vite** (Deprecated)

**Why This Must Be Done First:**
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Outdated dependencies have known security issues
2. **Compatibility Issues**: Modern tools won't work with old versions
3. **Development Experience**: Old versions lack modern features and performance improvements
4. **Future-Proofing**: New features require modern dependency versions

**Why This Approach**:
- ‚úÖ **80-90% code reusability** from existing e-commerce project
- ‚úÖ **6-12 months faster** than rebuilding from legacy
- ‚úÖ **$50k-100k cost savings** vs complete rebuild
- ‚úÖ **Direct V2 seeding** - every component ports to V2 spine
- ‚úÖ **Modern architecture** already in place (React + TypeScript + Redux)
