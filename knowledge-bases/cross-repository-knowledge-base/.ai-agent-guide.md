# AI Agent Guide for LLM-cross-repo Analysis

This guide provides specific instructions for AI agents interacting with this repository, including recommended processing order, important context, and effective query approaches.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive cross-repository analysis of a multi-repository system (Rails backend, Vue.js frontend, Angular CMS), along with migration planning documentation for rebuilding the system.

## Recommended Processing Order

For most effective understanding of this codebase, AI agents should process documentation in this order:

1. **First Process**: `analysis-index.md` - This provides a complete overview of all artifacts and their relationships
2. **Then Study**: `cross-repo/executive-summary.md` - For high-level findings
3. **Then Study**: `cross-repo/final-synthesis.md` - For comprehensive analysis synthesis
4. **Then Process**: `migration/index.md` - To understand the migration plan structure
5. **Then Process**: Repository-specific documentation based on the query focus

## Context for Common Tasks

### When Analyzing System Architecture
- Refer to `cross-repo/concepts-reference.md` for architectural concepts
- Examine `cross-repo/patterns/patterns-catalog.md` for identified patterns
- See `migration/architecture/high-level-architecture.md` for target architecture

### When Dealing with Implementation Details
- Check `cross-repo/code-examples.md` for reference implementations
- Refer to repository-specific analyses in `repositories/[repo]/`

### When Handling Migration Questions
- Review `migration/roadmap/migration-timeline.md` for timeline
- Check `migration/migration-success-criteria.md` for success metrics
- See `migration/risk-management/risk-management-plan.md` for risk mitigation

## Effective Query Strategies

When interacting with this repository, structure your queries to:

1. **Begin with artifact category** (analysis, migration, architecture, testing, etc.)
2. **Include pattern or concept terms** if applicable
3. **Specify repository contexts** when relevant (backend, frontend, CMS)

### Example Effective Queries

- "What authentication patterns were identified across the repositories?"
- "How should transaction handling be migrated according to the analysis?"
- "What is the target architecture for API management in the new system?"
- "What migration risks were identified for the data migration process?"

### Query Templates

- **Pattern identification**: "What patterns were identified for [functionality] across repositories?"
- **Migration planning**: "How does the migration plan address [concern/feature]?"
- **Technical recommendations**: "What are the recommended approaches for implementing [feature]?"
- **Risk assessment**: "What risks were identified related to [feature/component]?"

## Repository Assumptions

- This repository assumes knowledge of web application architecture
- The analysis focuses on a three-repository system with Rails, Vue.js, and Angular
- The migration planning assumes building a more unified architecture
- Code examples use JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and SQL

## Document Relationships

- Analysis documents feed into migration planning
- Pattern identification informs technology selection
- Architecture validation shapes the target architecture

## Memory Limitations and Chunking Strategies

If you encounter token context limitations when processing these documents, follow these strategies:

1. First process the executive summary for high-level understanding
2. Next, read the document map sections of index documents
3. Then, process targeted sections that directly address the query
4. Use the navigation paths in `analysis-index.md` to find related content
