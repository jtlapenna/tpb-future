## Purpose

This directory contains analysis specific to each individual repository (Frontend, CMS, and Backend), focusing on the internal architecture, components, and integration points of each repository. This includes:

- High-level architecture and technology stack
- Component-level analysis
- Repository-specific patterns
- Integration points with other repositories

## Repository Structure

### Frontend Repository (Vue.js)

The frontend analysis covers:
- Vue.js component structure and architecture (overview/frontend-knowledge-base-findings.md)
- Vuex state management
- API integration
- Frontend-specific patterns

### CMS Repository (Angular)

The CMS analysis covers:
- Angular module/component structure and architecture (overview/cms-knowledge-base-findings.md)
- RxJS-based state management
- API integration
- CMS-specific patterns

### Backend Repository (Rails)

The backend analysis covers:
- Rails model/controller structure and architecture (overview/api-knowledge-base-findings.md)
- API endpoints
