# Cross-Repository Specialized Analysis Templates

This directory contains specialized analysis templates designed for cross-repository analysis, focusing on technical aspects that span multiple repositories.

## Active Templates

### Core Analysis
- `code_review.md` - Code quality and implementation patterns across repositories
- `architecture.md` - Architectural patterns and system design across repositories
- `pattern.md` - Common design patterns and their implementation across codebases

### Technical Implementation
- `api.md` - API design patterns and integration points between repositories
- `error_handling.md` - Error handling patterns and recovery strategies
- `security.md` - Security implementation patterns and cross-cutting concerns

## Usage
1. These templates should be used in conjunction with core cross-repository analysis templates
2. They provide focused lenses for analyzing specific technical aspects across multiple repositories
3. Templates can be combined based on analysis needs

## Template Application
1. Start with relevant core cross-repo templates
2. Add specialized templates based on analysis focus
3. Ensure consistent cross-referencing between analyses
4. Document integration points and shared patterns

## Reference Templates
