# Event Integration Analysis

## Overview
This document provides a detailed analysis of event integration patterns across the three repositories, with a focus on cross-repository event handling, event emission, and event-based communication strategies.

**Sources Reviewed:**
- Frontend: `src/analytics/events.js`, `src/analytics/analytics.js`, `src/api/products/ProductsRepo.js`
- CMS: `src/app/stores/store/store.component.ts`, `src/app/product-layouts/product-layout-tab/product-layout-tab.component.ts`
- Repository Analysis: `repositories/front-end/INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` (Event Integration Analysis section)

## Key Findings

### Event Architecture Patterns

#### Frontend (Vue.js) Event Patterns
- **Component-level Events**: The Vue.js application uses the standard Vue event system with `$emit` and event listeners:
  ```javascript
  // From ProductsRepo.js
  this.$root.$emit('custom_event_name')
  ```
- **Analytics Events**: A dedicated events system for analytics tracking is implemented using IndexedDB for local storage:
  ```javascript
  // From analytics.js
  track(eventName, eventParams = {}, eventResponse = {}) {
    let event = {
      event_datetime: new Date(),
      event_name: eventName,
      event_params: JSON.stringify(eventParams),
      event_resp: JSON.stringify(eventResponse),
      session_id: '',
      user_id: ''
    }
    return Events.save(event)
  }
  ```
- **Service Worker Events**: The application uses service worker events for offline capabilities and updates:
  ```javascript
  // From main.js
  window.addEventListener('load', () => startSW(vm))
  ```

#### CMS (Angular) Event Patterns
- **EventEmitter Pattern**: Angular components utilize the `@Output()` and `EventEmitter` for parent-child communication:
  ```typescript
  // From product-layout-tab.component.ts
  import { Component, OnInit, Input, Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';
  
  interface AddElementEvent {
    elements: FormArray;
    type: string;
  }
  ```
- **RxJS Subject Pattern**: Components use RxJS subjects to emit events between unrelated components:
  ```typescript
  // From store.component.ts
  addTax() {
    this.emitEventToChild.next('Add-tax');
  }
  ```

### Cross-Repository Event Flow

#### Analytics Event Flow
1. **Event Generation** (Frontend):
   - User interactions trigger analytics events in the frontend
   - Events are captured and stored locally in IndexedDB via `Events.save()`
   
2. **Event Aggregation** (Frontend â†’ Backend):
   - Events are periodically sent to the backend via `EventsAPI.uploadEvents()`:
     ```javascript
     // From EventsAPI.js
     uploadEvents(data, token) {
       return Axios.post(this.baseurl, data, {
         headers: {
           'Content-Type': 'application/json',
           'Accept': 'application/json',
           'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
         }
       })
     }
     ```
   
3. **Event Processing** (Backend):
   - Events are received and processed by the backend APIs
   - No direct event propagation from backend to other clients is evident

### Event Types and Categories

#### User Interaction Events
- Product view events
- Add to cart events
- Checkout events
- Navigation events

#### System Events
- Application initialization
- Configuration loading
- Service worker updates
- Connection status changes

#### Data Lifecycle Events
- Data loading
- Data updates
- Data synchronization
- Data persistence

### Event Storage and Persistence

#### Frontend Local Storage
- **IndexedDB Storage**: The frontend uses IndexedDB to store events locally:
  ```javascript
  // From db.js
  request.onupgradeneeded = e => {
    console.log('onupgradeneeded')
    let db = e.target.result
    db.createObjectStore('events', { autoIncrement: !0, keyPath: 'id' })
  }
  ```
  
- **Event Batch Processing**: Events appear to be stored locally and then uploaded in batches to the backend API

## Integration Challenges and Patterns

### Challenges Identified
1. **Limited Cross-Repository Event Propagation**: There is no established pattern for real-time event propagation across repositories
2. **Decentralized Event Definitions**: Event structures and types are defined in multiple places without centralized definitions
3. **Asynchronous Event Handling**: Both frontend applications handle events asynchronously, which can lead to race conditions

### Effective Patterns
1. **Local-First Event Storage**: Frontend stores events locally before sending to backend, enabling offline functionality
2. **Event Categorization**: Events are well-categorized based on their purpose (analytics, user interaction, system)
3. **Typed Event Interfaces**: Angular components use strongly-typed event interfaces

## Questions & Gaps

### Open Questions
1. How are real-time events propagated between client applications?
2. Is there a mechanism for event deduplication or ordering when synchronizing offline events?
3. How are error conditions in event processing handled?

### Areas Needing Investigation
- Event error handling patterns
- Event-based communication between frontend and CMS
- Real-time event notifications (if any)
- Event versioning and backward compatibility

### Potential Risks
- **Event Loss**: Local event storage could lead to event loss if synchronization fails
- **Event Duplication**: Lack of clear deduplication strategy could lead to duplicate events
- **Inconsistent Event Handling**: Different event handling patterns across repositories could lead to inconsistent behavior

## Next Steps
1. Document event schemas and formats
2. Analyze event error handling patterns
3. Investigate real-time event notification options
4. Establish best practices for cross-repository event handling
