# Audit Summaries Analysis Findings

## Overview
**Purpose**: Analyze the initial audit summaries to understand cross-repository patterns, relationships, and key areas for investigation.

**Sources Reviewed**: 
- `audit_summaries/pattern_analysis.md`
- `audit_summaries/cross_repository_analysis.md`

**Scope**: Initial high-level analysis of patterns and relationships across repositories, focusing on architectural patterns, integration points, and common implementation approaches.

## Key Findings

### Major Patterns/Insights
