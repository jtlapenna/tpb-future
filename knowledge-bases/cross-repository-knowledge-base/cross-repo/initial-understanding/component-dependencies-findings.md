# Component Dependencies Analysis

## Overview
**Purpose**: This analysis examines the component dependencies across the three main repositories (Frontend, CMS, and Backend) to understand how these systems interact, share data, and maintain cohesion.

**Sources Reviewed**:
- Front-end Vue.js application: Component structure, API integration
- CMS Angular application: Component structure, services layer
- Backend Rails application: API controllers, resource endpoints
- Dependency graphs and import relationships

**Scope**: Focus on identifying cross-repository dependencies, service boundaries, and communication patterns between distinct system components.

## Key Findings

### Architectural Patterns
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: The system implements a clear separation between frontend clients (Vue.js and Angular) and the backend API service.
- **Shared Domain Model**: Common resource types (products, stores, carts) are represented consistently across all three repositories, enabling cohesive data flow.
- **API-First Design**: The backend exposes a comprehensive REST API that both frontend applications consume independently.

### Critical Dependencies
- **Cross-Repository Communication**: All inter-system communication flows through the Rails API, with no direct connection between the Vue.js frontend and Angular CMS.
- **Authentication Coupling**: Both frontend applications rely on the same token-based authentication system provided by the backend.
- **Resource Synchronization**: Changes made in the CMS propagate to the customer-facing frontend through backend-mediated synchronization.

## Detailed Analysis

### Frontend Component Dependencies

#### Vue.js Component Structure
The frontend application implements a component hierarchy with the following key dependencies:
- **Screen Components**: High-level container components such as `ScreenProducts`, `ScreenCart`, and `ScreenCheckout` orchestrate the user experience.
- **Product Components**: Reusable components like `ProductCard`, `ProductCardSale`, and `ProductImage` encapsulate product-specific UI behavior.
- **Cart Components**: Components such as `ActiveCartButton` and `ScreenCart` handle shopping cart functionality.

#### Frontend-to-Backend Dependencies
The Vue.js frontend communicates with the backend through a structured API layer:
- **API Service**: The `api.js` module centralizes all HTTP communication using Axios.
- **Repository Pattern**: `LocalRepo.js` and `RemoteRepo.js` abstract the data access logic, enabling offline-first capabilities.
- **Resource Endpoints**: Frontend components depend on backend controllers for:
  - Product catalog access (via `ProductsController`)
  - Shopping cart management (via `CartsController`)
  - Order processing (via `OrdersController`)

### CMS Component Dependencies

#### Angular Service Structure
The CMS implements a service-oriented architecture with:
- **Core Services**: Base services like `CrudService` provide generic CRUD operations for all resource types.
- **Resource-Specific Services**: Services such as `StoreSyncService` implement specialized logic for particular resource types.
- **Component-Service Dependencies**: Angular components depend on these services for data access and manipulation.

#### CMS-to-Backend Dependencies
The Angular CMS communicates with the backend through:
- **HTTP Client Abstraction**: Angular's `HttpClient` wrapped in custom services manages all API communications.
- **Resource Path Construction**: Services construct appropriate API endpoints for each resource type.
- **Typed Response Mapping**: Services transform API responses into strongly typed Angular models.

### Backend Component Dependencies

#### Controller Structure
The Rails backend implements a resource-oriented controller structure:
- **Resource Controllers**: Controllers like `ProductsController`, `CartsController`, and `OrdersController` manage specific resource types.
- **API Versioning**: The `api/v1` namespace encapsulates the current API version.

#### Cross-Client Support
The backend implements features to support both frontend clients:
- **Shared Authentication**: The `ApplicationController` includes authentication mechanisms used by both clients.
- **Consistent JSON Serialization**: Responses are formatted consistently for consumption by both frontend applications.

### Cross-Repository Workflows

#### Product Management Workflow
1. CMS components allow administrators to create/update products via the `ProductsController`
2. Frontend components retrieve product data through the same controller
3. Product changes flow: CMS → Backend → Frontend

#### Shopping Cart Workflow
1. Frontend components create and manage carts via the `CartsController`
2. Cart state is persisted in the backend
3. Order checkout transitions cart data to orders via the `OrdersController`

## Questions & Gaps

### Open Questions
- How are breaking changes in the API handled between the two frontend applications?
- What is the deployment synchronization strategy when API changes affect both client applications?

### Areas Needing Investigation
- Detailed API versioning strategy and backward compatibility approach
- Error handling consistency across repositories
- Contract testing between frontend applications and the backend API

### Potential Risks
- **API Drift**: Without careful management, the backend API could evolve in ways that break one client but not the other
- **Inconsistent Validation**: Business logic implemented differently across repositories could lead to data inconsistencies
- **Authentication Synchronization**: Shared authentication mechanisms create potential security risks if not carefully managed

## Next Steps

- Investigate API versioning strategy and change management process
- Document specific service boundaries and responsibility domains
- Analyze deployment strategies for coordinated releases
- Examine error handling patterns across repository boundaries
- Identify opportunities for shared code or contract testing
