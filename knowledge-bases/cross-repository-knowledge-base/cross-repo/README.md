## Purpose

This directory contains the comprehensive cross-repository analysis of the system, focusing on how the three repositories (Frontend, CMS, and Backend) interact and integrate with each other. This includes:

- Synthesis of findings across repositories
- Cross-repository design patterns
- Integration analysis between repositories
- Dependency management across repositories
- Data flow analysis across repositories
- Infrastructure and deployment analysis

## Key Documents

1. [Final Synthesis](./final-synthesis.md) - Comprehensive synthesis of all findings
2. [Executive Summary](./executive-summary.md) - High-level overview of all findings
3. [Infrastructure Findings](./infrastructure-findings.md) - Analysis of infrastructure and deployment
4. [Authentication Flow](./integration/auth-flow-findings.md) - Authentication flow across repositories
5. [API Integration](./integration/api-integration-findings.md) - API integration patterns
6. [Dependency Management](./dependencies/dependency-management-findings.md) - Dependency management across repositories
7. [Findings Verification](./verification/findings-verification.md) - Verification of key findings
8. [Validation Plan](./verification/validation-plan.md) - Plan for validating patterns and implementations

## Patterns Identified

The analysis has identified the following cross-repository patterns:

1. [Integration Patterns](./patterns/integration/integration-patterns.md) - Patterns for integrating components across repositories
2. [Dependency Patterns](./patterns/dependencies/dependency-patterns.md) - Patterns for managing dependencies
3. [Data Flow Patterns](./patterns/data-flows/data-flow-patterns.md) - Patterns for managing data flows
4. [Security Patterns](./patterns/security/security-patterns.md) - Patterns for implementing security
5. [Deployment Patterns](./patterns/deployment/deployment-patterns.md) - Patterns for deployment

## Synthesis Documents

The synthesis process involved several steps:

1. [Unified Analysis](./synthesis/unified-analysis.md) - Initial synthesis of knowledge base findings
2. [Contradiction Resolution](./synthesis/contradiction-resolution.md) - Resolution of contradictions found in analysis
3. [Knowledge Gaps](./synthesis/knowledge-gaps.md) - Identified knowledge gaps and resolution plans
4. [Final Synthesis](./final-synthesis.md) - Comprehensive synthesis of all findings
