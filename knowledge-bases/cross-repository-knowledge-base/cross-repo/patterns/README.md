# Design Patterns Analysis

This directory contains analysis of design patterns identified across the three repositories.

## Contents

- [Integration Patterns](integration/integration-patterns.md) - Patterns used for integrating different components and repositories
- [Security Patterns](security/security-patterns.md) - Patterns used for implementing security features
- [Dependency Patterns](dependencies/dependency-patterns.md) - Patterns used for managing dependencies
- [Data Flow Patterns](data-flows/data-flow-patterns.md) - Patterns used for managing data flows between components
- [Deployment Patterns](deployment/deployment-patterns.md) - Patterns used for deployment and infrastructure management

## Purpose

These documents identify common design patterns used throughout the codebase, their implementations, benefits, and challenges. They serve as a reference for understanding the system architecture and inform future development decisions.

Each pattern document includes:
- Pattern name and category
- Implementation details across repositories
- Benefits and challenges of each pattern
- Examples from the codebase
- Recommendations for improvement
