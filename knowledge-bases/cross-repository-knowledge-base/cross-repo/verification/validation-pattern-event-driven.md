# Event-Driven Updates Pattern Validation

## Pattern Overview
**Pattern Name**: Event-Driven Updates
**Pattern Description**: A pattern that enables real-time data propagation across system components through event publishing and subscription mechanisms, ensuring consistent and timely data updates.

## Validation Plan

### Implementation Evidence to Collect
- Event generation mechanisms
- Event subscription systems
- Real-time notification implementations
- WebSocket configurations
- Message queue usage
- Frontend update handlers
- Event serialization formats
- Error handling in event flows

### Validation Criteria
- Reliable event delivery
- Proper event format consistency
- Effective subscription mechanisms
- Handling of connection failures
- Systematic event naming conventions
- Clear event payload structures
- Event-based UI updates
- Cross-repository event consistency

## Implementation Areas to Validate

### Backend (Ruby on Rails)
- [ ] Event generation mechanisms
- [ ] WebSocket server implementation
- [ ] Background job processing
- [ ] Event persistence
- [ ] Notification delivery systems
- [ ] Error handling for event failures
- [ ] Event authentication/authorization

### CMS Frontend (Angular)
- [ ] WebSocket client implementation
- [ ] Event subscription management
- [ ] UI update patterns from events
- [ ] Real-time notification components
- [ ] Event handling error recovery

### Frontend (Vue.js)
- [ ] WebSocket client configuration
- [ ] Event-based UI refresh mechanisms
- [ ] User notification components
- [ ] Reconnection handling
- [ ] Real-time data state management

## Cross-Repository Validation
- [ ] Consistent event naming across repositories
- [ ] Compatible event payload structures
- [ ] End-to-end event flow validation
- [ ] Error handling consistency
