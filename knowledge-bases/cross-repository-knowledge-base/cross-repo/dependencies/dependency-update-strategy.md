# Dependency Update Strategy Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the dependency update strategies employed across the three repositories. It examines update approaches, automation tools, security practices, and the challenges in maintaining consistent and secure dependencies.

**Sources Reviewed:**
- Backend: Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, setup scripts
- Frontend: package.json, package-lock.json, build scripts
- CMS: package.json, package-lock.json, build scripts
- Cross-repository dependency coordination

## Key Findings

### Update Strategies by Repository

#### Backend (Ruby/Rails)
The backend repository employs Ruby's Bundler for dependency management and updates. The update strategy shows:

```ruby
# From Gemfile
ruby '~> 3.0.0'
gem 'rails', '~> 6.1.0'
gem 'puma', '~> 5.6'
gem 'active_model_serializers', '~> 0.10.0'
```

**Key observations:**
- Consistent use of semantic versioning constraints via the tilde operator (`~>`)
- Conservative version pinning for core components like Rails
- More flexible constraints for development dependencies
- Use of `bundle update` commands for systematic updates
- Setup script (`bin/setup`) includes dependency installation: `system('bundle check') || system!('bundle install')`

#### Frontend (Vue.js)
The Frontend repository uses npm for dependency management, with a combination of exact and flexible version constraints:

```json
// From package.json
"devDependencies": {
  "autoprefixer": "^7.1.2",
  "babel-core": "^6.22.1",
  "webpack": "^3.6.0"
}
```

**Key observations:**
- Caret operator (`^`) for most dependencies, allowing patch and minor version updates
- Version checking automation via the `check-versions.js` script
- Engine requirements explicitly defined: `"node": "14", "npm": "6"`
- Use of `package-lock.json` for deterministic installs
- No evident automated security scanning

#### CMS (Angular)
The CMS repository also uses npm, with version constraints focused on Angular ecosystem compatibility:

```json
// From package.json
"dependencies": {
  "@angular/animations": "~8.2.14",
  "@angular/common": "~8.2.14",
  "@angular/core": "~8.2.14"
}
```

**Key observations:**
- Consistent version pinning with tilde operator (`~`) for Angular packages
- Exact matches for critical dependencies
- Caret operator (`^`) for less critical third-party libraries
- Angular CLI dependency management conventions
- No evident automated security scanning

### Update Automation and Tools

| Repository | Update Tools | Automation Level | Security Scanning |
|------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Backend | Bundler | Manual with helpers | RuboCop security plugins |
| Frontend | npm/Node version checker | Semi-automated | No evident automated scanning |
| CMS | npm | Manual | No evident automated scanning |

**Key findings:**
- Backend has the most structured update approach with Bundler
- Frontend includes version checking automation for Node/npm
- CMS appears to rely on manual updates
- Limited evidence of security vulnerability scanning across repositories
- No coordinated cross-repository update strategy

### Security Practices in Updates

#### Backend
- RuboCop integration with security-focused plugins
- Conservative version constraints for critical components
- Clear separation of production and development dependencies
- No evident automated vulnerability scanning

#### Frontend
- Version constraint validation through check-versions.js
- Lock file usage for dependency determinism 
- Engine version validation
- No evident security scanning tools

#### CMS
- Fixed versions for Angular core libraries
- Some Sentry integration for error tracking
- Environment-specific build configurations
- No evident automated security scanning

### Cross-Repository Update Coordination

There is limited evidence of coordinated update strategies across repositories. Key observations:

1. **Isolated Update Processes**: Each repository appears to manage its dependencies independently
2. **No Shared Update Documentation**: No documented process for coordinating updates
3. **Potential Integration Issues**: Updates in one repository may affect interactions with others
4. **Differing Update Frequencies**: Evidence suggests inconsistent update cadences

### Effective Patterns Identified

1. **Version Constraint Consistency**: Each repository shows internal consistency in version constraint approaches
2. **Lock Files**: All repositories use lock files for deterministic installations
3. **Environment Validation**: Frontend validates development environment requirements
4. **Dependency Isolation**: Clear separation of dependencies by environment/purpose

## Challenges and Recommendations

### Current Challenges

1. **Security Vulnerability Management**
   - Limited automated scanning for vulnerabilities
   - No documented process for security updates
   - Outdated dependencies with potential security implications
   - No evident CVE tracking

2. **Cross-Repository Coordination**
   - No synchronized update strategy across repositories
   - Potential for incompatible updates
   - Lack of shared API version management
   - No documented impact analysis process

3. **Update Automation**
   - Limited automation for dependency updates
   - Manual security review requirements
   - No evident continuous integration for dependency updates
   - No standardized update schedule

4. **Technical Debt Management**
   - Outdated framework versions (Angular 8, Vue.js 2)
   - Dependency on deprecated packages
   - Complex upgrade paths for core frameworks
   - No evident strategy for major version upgrades

### Recommended Strategy

#### 1. Establish a Unified Update Process

**Implementation Steps:**
- Create a cross-repository dependency inventory
- Document shared dependencies and their version requirements
- Establish update coordination meetings or processes
- Implement API version management

#### 2. Implement Security Scanning

**Implementation Steps:**
- Add `bundle audit` for the Ruby backend
- Implement `npm audit` or `yarn audit` for JavaScript repositories
- Integrate scanning into CI/CD pipeline
- Establish security update SLAs

#### 3. Automate Update Processes

**Implementation Steps:**
- Add Dependabot or similar for automated update PRs
- Create update automation scripts
- Implement test automation for dependency updates
- Document update review process

#### 4. Create a Technical Debt Reduction Plan

**Implementation Steps:**
- Prioritize framework upgrades (Angular, Vue.js)
- Create migration paths for deprecated dependencies
- Implement progressive update strategy
- Document compatibility requirements

### Prioritized Update Approach

| Priority | Component | Update Approach | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| High | Security vulnerabilities | Immediate patching via dedicated PRs | As discovered |
| High | Shared API dependencies | Coordinated updates with cross-repo testing | Monthly |
| Medium | Core frameworks | Planned major version upgrades | Quarterly planning |
| Medium | Development dependencies | Regular updates with automated PRs | Bi-weekly |
| Low | Minor feature enhancements | Batch updates | Monthly |

## Questions & Gaps

### Open Questions

1. What is the current process for handling security vulnerabilities?
2. How are cross-repository dependency conflicts resolved?
3. Is there a test suite sufficient to verify dependency updates?
4. What is the strategy for upgrading to newer Angular and Vue.js versions?

### Areas Needing Investigation

- Current security scanning practices
- Impact of framework upgrades on existing functionality
- Test coverage for dependency-related functionality
- CI/CD pipeline integration for dependency updates

### Potential Risks

- **Security Vulnerability Exposure**: Delayed security updates increase risk
- **Dependency Hell**: Complex dependency trees complicate updates
- **Breaking Changes**: Major version updates may cause incompatibilities
- **Technical Debt Accumulation**: Deferred updates increase upgrade difficulty
- **Developer Productivity**: Outdated dependencies impact developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Implement automated security scanning for all repositories
2. Create dependency inventory and shared dependency documentation
3. Establish cross-repository update coordination process
4. Develop framework upgrade roadmap for frontend and CMS
5. Implement automated dependency update PRs
