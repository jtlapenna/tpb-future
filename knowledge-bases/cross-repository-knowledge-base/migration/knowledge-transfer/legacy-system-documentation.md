# Legacy System Documentation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive approach to documenting the existing legacy system across all three repositories (Backend, Frontend, and CMS). Thorough documentation is essential for preserving institutional knowledge, ensuring accurate system recreation, and enabling developers to understand existing functionality during the migration process.

## Documentation Goals

1. **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture tacit knowledge from current developers and stakeholders
2. **Architectural Understanding**: Document system architecture, dependencies, and data flows
3. **Functional Mapping**: Create comprehensive maps of business functionality
4. **Technical Debt Identification**: Document workarounds, hacks, and technical debt
5. **Migration Planning Support**: Provide information necessary for migration planning

## Documentation Methods

### 1. Code Analysis
- [ ] Automated code documentation generation
- [ ] Static analysis tools for dependency mapping
- [ ] Database schema analysis
- [ ] API endpoint documentation

### 2. Knowledge Extraction
- [ ] Developer interviews and walkthroughs
- [ ] Business stakeholder interviews
- [ ] Observation of system usage
- [ ] Review of existing documentation

### 3. System Exploration
- [ ] Feature mapping through UI exploration
- [ ] API testing and documentation
- [ ] Database query analysis
- [ ] Log analysis for usage patterns

## Documentation Formats

1. **Markdown Documentation**: Primary format for textual documentation
2. **Architectural Diagrams**: UML diagrams, C4 model diagrams
3. **Database Diagrams**: ERD and schema documentation
4. **Process Flows**: Business process model notation diagrams
5. **Code Documentation**: Inline comments and generated API docs
6. **Video Walkthroughs**: Screen recordings of key functionality
7. **Knowledge Base**: Searchable repository of documentation

## Documentation Prioritization

### High Priority (Complete First)
- Core business workflows
- Data models and relationships
- API contracts
- Authentication and security mechanisms
- Integration points between systems

### Medium Priority
- UI component documentation
- Exception handling
- Deployment processes
- Performance considerations
- Testing strategies

### Lower Priority
- Administrative functions
- Reporting capabilities
- Development environment setup
- Non-critical edge cases

## Documentation Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define documentation scope for each area
   - Identify subject matter experts
   - Schedule knowledge extraction sessions
   - Set up documentation repository

2. **Knowledge Extraction Phase**
   - Conduct interviews and walkthroughs
   - Analyze existing documentation
   - Explore system functionality
   - Map business processes

3. **Documentation Creation Phase**
   - Create initial documentation drafts
   - Develop architectural diagrams
   - Document code and database structures
   - Record video walkthroughs

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Review documentation with subject matter experts
   - Validate accuracy of technical documentation
   - Ensure documentation coverage
   - Address gaps and inconsistencies

5. **Finalization Phase**
   - Format and organize documentation
   - Create cross-references and indexes
   - Establish documentation maintenance process
   - Publish documentation to knowledge base

## Timeline and Resources

### Timeline
- Documentation planning: 2 weeks
- Knowledge extraction: 4-6 weeks
- Documentation creation: 8-10 weeks
- Validation and refinement: 4 weeks
- Finalization: 2 weeks

### Required Resources
- Technical documentation specialists
- Subject matter experts from each repository team
- Business analysts 
- Architects
- UX/UI specialists
