# Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the system rebuild and migration project. The strategy ensures that the new system meets functional and non-functional requirements, maintains data integrity during migration, and provides a seamless transition for users. The testing approach is designed to identify and mitigate risks throughout the development lifecycle.

## Testing Principles

1. **Shift Left Testing**: Begin testing early in the development lifecycle to identify issues when they are least expensive to fix
2. **Continuous Testing**: Integrate testing into the CI/CD pipeline for immediate feedback
3. **Risk-Based Testing**: Focus testing efforts on high-risk, high-impact areas
4. **Automated First**: Automate tests wherever feasible to enable frequent execution
5. **Behavior-Driven Development**: Define expected behaviors before implementation
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test across all layers of the application architecture
7. **Parallel Test Environments**: Maintain separate environments for different testing phases
