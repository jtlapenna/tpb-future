# Data Migration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating data from the existing three-repository system (Rails backend, Vue.js frontend, and Angular CMS) to the new architecture. The data migration is a critical component of the overall system rebuild and requires careful planning to ensure data integrity, minimal business disruption, and successful transition.

## Data Migration Principles

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensure complete and accurate transfer of all business-critical data
2. **Zero Data Loss**: Implement verification processes to confirm no data is lost during migration
3. **Business Continuity**: Minimize disruption to business operations during migration
4. **Reversibility**: Maintain ability to rollback to legacy systems if needed
5. **Incremental Approach**: Migrate data in logical business domains rather than all at once
6. **Validation-First**: Thoroughly validate data before final migration

## Current Data Landscape

### Data Sources

1. **Primary Relational Database (Rails Backend)**
   - PostgreSQL database with normalized schema
   - Contains core business data (orders, products, customers, etc.)
   - Estimated data volume: [X] GB

2. **User Authentication Data**
   - User credentials and permissions
   - Roles and access controls

3. **Media and Assets**
   - Product images and related media
   - Document attachments
   - Static content and resources

4. **Configuration Data**
   - System configuration settings
   - Environment-specific variables
   - Feature flags and toggles

5. **Historical/Archived Data**
   - Completed orders beyond active retention period
   - Audit logs and system events
   - Historical performance metrics

## Target Data Architecture

The new system will use a combination of:

1. **Primary Relational Database**
   - Core transactional data requiring ACID properties
   - Reference data requiring strong consistency

2. **Document Store**
   - Semi-structured data
   - Content and configuration management
   - Historical records and audit data

3. **Search Index**
   - Product and content search capabilities
   - Full-text indexing and faceted search

4. **Object Storage**
   - Media assets and binary files
   - Document attachments and files
   - Backup archives

5. **Cache Layer**
   - Frequently accessed reference data
   - Session data and temporary storage

## Data Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation

2. **Data Mapping**
   - [ ] Create field-level mappings from source to target
   - [ ] Identify data transformation requirements
   - [ ] Document business rules for data transformation
   - [ ] Define validation rules for migrated data

3. **Migration Tooling Selection**
   - [ ] Evaluate custom vs. off-the-shelf migration tools

   - [ ] Measure performance and optimize processes
   - [ ] Document and resolve issues

2. **Full-Scale Rehearsal**
   - [ ] Conduct full migration in staging environment
   - [ ] Simulate production conditions including volume
   - [ ] Test entire migration sequence
   - [ ] Verify all business processes with migrated data

3. **Cutover Rehearsal**
   - [ ] Practice the cutover process including timing
   - [ ] Test rollback procedures
   - [ ] Verify business operations post-migration
   - [ ] Finalize cutover checklist and procedures

### Phase 4: Production Migration

1. **Pre-Migration**
   - [ ] Freeze legacy system configuration changes
   - [ ] Take final backups of all source systems
   - [ ] Set up monitoring and command center
   - [ ] Communicate migration schedule to stakeholders

2. **Domain-by-Domain Migration**
   - [ ] Execute migration according to defined sequence
   - [ ] Perform validation after each domain migration
   - [ ] Address issues immediately during process
   - [ ] Provide regular status updates to stakeholders

3. **Synchronization Period**
   - [ ] Maintain synchronization between legacy and new systems
   - [ ] Gradually shift user traffic to new system
   - [ ] Monitor for data inconsistencies
   - [ ] Reconcile data between systems regularly

4. **Final Cutover**
   - [ ] Complete final data synchronization
   - [ ] Perform final validation and verification
   - [ ] Switch all traffic to new system
   - [ ] Monitor intensively post-cutover

5. **Post-Migration**
   - [ ] Verify all business processes functioning correctly
   - [ ] Resolve any data-related issues
   - [ ] Archive legacy data according to retention policy
   - [ ] Document lessons learned
