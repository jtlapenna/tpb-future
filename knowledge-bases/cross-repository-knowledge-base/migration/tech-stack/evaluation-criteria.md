# Technology Stack Evaluation Criteria

## Overview
This document defines the criteria for evaluating and selecting the technology stack for the system rebuild. These criteria will be used to assess language, framework, database, and infrastructure options to ensure the selection aligns with business requirements and technical goals.

## Evaluation Categories

### 1. Technical Capability
- **Modern Language Features**: Support for modern programming paradigms, type systems, and language features
- **Performance Characteristics**: Speed, resource utilization, and scalability
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Library availability, community support, and tool quality
- **Security Features**: Built-in security capabilities and vulnerability management
- **Testing Support**: Testing frameworks, mocking capabilities, and coverage tools

### 2. Developer Experience
- **Learning Curve**: Ease of adoption for the current team
- **Developer Productivity**: Language expressiveness, boilerplate reduction, and tooling
- **Local Development**: Ease of setting up and working in local environments
- **Code Quality Tools**: Linting, static analysis, and code formatting tools
- **IDE Support**: Quality of editor/IDE integration and developer tooling

### 3. Operational Characteristics
- **Deployment Complexity**: Ease of building, packaging, and deploying
- **Monitoring Capabilities**: Logging, metrics, and observability features
- **Resource Requirements**: CPU, memory, and storage footprints
- **Scaling Properties**: Horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities
- **Containerization Support**: Docker and Kubernetes compatibility

### 4. Business Alignment
- **Talent Availability**: Market availability of developers with relevant skills
- **Cost Implications**: Licensing, infrastructure, and operational costs
- **Vendor Independence**: Avoidance of vendor lock-in where possible
- **Long-term Viability**: Language and framework future outlook
- **Support Options**: Commercial and community support availability

### 5. Migration-Specific Considerations
- **Interoperability**: Ability to communicate with legacy systems during migration
- **Data Migration Capabilities**: Tools and approaches for data transfer
- **Incremental Adoption**: Support for phased migration approach
- **Legacy System Integration**: API compatibility and integration options
- **Feature Parity Achievability**: Ability to implement all required features

## Scoring Methodology

Each technology option will be evaluated using a weighted scoring system:

| Criteria Category | Weight | Justification |
|-------------------|--------|---------------|
| Technical Capability | 30% | Core capabilities determine what's possible |
| Developer Experience | 25% | Critical for team productivity and code quality |
| Operational Characteristics | 20% | Important for long-term maintenance and stability |
| Business Alignment | 15% | Ensures alignment with business goals and constraints |
| Migration-Specific Considerations | 10% | Temporary but critical for successful transition |

Each specific criterion within a category will be scored on a scale of 1-5:
1. **Poor**: Does not meet requirements
2. **Fair**: Minimally meets requirements with significant compromises
3. **Good**: Adequately meets requirements
4. **Very Good**: Exceeds requirements in some areas
5. **Excellent**: Substantially exceeds requirements

## Technology Categories for Evaluation

### Languages and Frameworks
- Backend language options (e.g., Go, Rust, TypeScript/Node.js, Python, Java)
- Frontend framework options (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte)
- API development frameworks
- Mobile development frameworks (if applicable)

### Database and Storage
- Relational database options
- NoSQL database options
- Caching technologies
- Object storage solutions
- Search engine technologies

### Infrastructure and DevOps
- Cloud providers
- Container orchestration
- CI/CD platforms
- Infrastructure-as-Code tools
- Monitoring and observability solutions

## Evaluation Process

1. **Research Phase**: Gather information about candidate technologies
2. **Initial Filtering**: Eliminate options that fail to meet critical requirements
3. **Detailed Assessment**: Score remaining options against all criteria
4. **Proof of Concept**: Build small prototypes with top candidates
5. **Team Review**: Gather feedback from development team
6. **Final Selection**: Document decision with justifications

## Expected Outputs

The evaluation process will produce the following documents:

1. **Language and Framework Evaluation**: `language-framework-options.md`
2. **Database Options Assessment**: `database-options.md`
3. **Cloud Infrastructure Evaluation**: `cloud-infrastructure-options.md`
4. **Final Technology Selection**: `tech-stack-selection.md`

Each document will include:
- Technologies considered
- Evaluation scores with justifications
- Strengths and weaknesses of each option
- Recommendations and rationale
- Implementation considerations

## Next Steps

1. Identify specific technology options for each category
2. Create evaluation matrices for each category
3. Conduct research and gather data for assessment
4. Schedule team review sessions
5. Complete evaluations and document results
