# Migration Knowledge Base Index

## Overview
This document serves as a central index for the migration knowledge base, organizing all analysis documents, patterns, findings, and reference materials to facilitate easy access during the migration project. The knowledge base is structured to support effective knowledge transfer, decision-making, and implementation guidance.

### 4. Cross-Repository Findings

#### Analysis Documents
- [Executive Summary](../../analysis/cross-repo/verification/executive-summary.md) - Summary of key findings
- [Final Synthesis](../../analysis/cross-repo/final-synthesis.md) - Complete synthesis and conclusions
- [Implementation Plan](../../analysis/cross-repo/verification/implementation-plan.md) - Recommended approach for implementation

#### API Contracts
