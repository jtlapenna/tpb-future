# Migration Timeline

## Overview
This document outlines the timeline for the complete rebuild and migration from the existing three-repository system (Rails backend, Vue.js frontend, and Angular CMS) to the new architecture. The timeline is organized into phases with clear milestones, dependencies, and success criteria to ensure a structured approach to the migration.

## Risk Management During Migration

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Data migration errors** | High | Multiple rehearsals, validation scripts, rollback capability |
| **Performance degradation** | High | Performance testing at each phase, optimization sprints |
| **User adoption challenges** | Medium | Early user involvement, comprehensive training, phased approach |
| **Integration failures** | High | Comprehensive testing, component isolation, fallback mechanisms |
| **Timeline slippage** | Medium | Buffer periods in schedule, prioritization of features, scope management |
| **Resource constraints** | Medium | Early resource planning, cross-training, prioritized implementation |

## Dependencies and Critical Path

1. **Technology selection** must be completed before foundation building
2. **Core infrastructure** must be in place before domain implementation
3. **Authentication services** must be functional before other secure services
4. **Data migration scripts** must be validated before pilot migration
5. **All domains** must be implemented before full cutover
6. **Training materials** must be ready before user migration

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked against this timeline using:

1. **Milestone reviews** at the end of each phase
2. **Bi-weekly status reporting** against planned activities
3. **Monthly steering committee reviews** of overall progress
4. **Continuous tracking** of success criteria for each phase
