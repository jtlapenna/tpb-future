## Analysis Strategy
1. For each subdirectory:
   - Compare content with output directory
   - Identify unique valuable content
   - Note more detailed or updated information
   - Flag content for inclusion in final package

2. Quality Criteria:
   - Completeness of information
   - Technical accuracy
   - Currency of content
   - Clarity and usability
   - Cross-referencing quality
   - Implementation details
