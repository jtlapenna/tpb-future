# Reference Materials Analysis

## Overview
This document tracks the analysis of reference materials in The Peak Beyond's codebase, identifying key documentation, assessing completeness, and documenting findings.

## Reference Materials Inventory

### Core Reference Documents
1. **Glossary** (`knowledge-base/meta/glossary/master_glossary.md`)
   - Status: In Progress (75% complete)
   - Contains system-wide and domain-specific terms
   - Well-organized with cross-references
   - Missing terms for order, customer, and inventory management

2. **API Reference** (`knowledge-base/reference/api_reference.md`)
   - Status: To Be Reviewed
   - Expected to contain:
     - Endpoint URLs
     - Request/response formats
     - Authentication requirements
     - Error codes and handling

3. **Common Patterns** (`knowledge-base/reference/common_patterns.md`)
   - Status: To Be Reviewed
   - Expected to contain:
     - Design patterns
     - Implementation patterns
     - Testing patterns
     - Error handling patterns

4. **Troubleshooting Guide** (`knowledge-base/reference/troubleshooting_guide.md`)
   - Status: To Be Reviewed
   - Expected to contain:
     - Common errors and solutions
     - Debugging techniques
     - Logging and monitoring
     - Performance issues

## Analysis Progress

### Completed Analysis

- Cross-references are used effectively
- Clear separation between different types of documentation
- Good use of templates and standardized formats

### Documentation Quality
- Master glossary is well-maintained and comprehensive
- Security-related documentation is thorough
- Some sections need updating or completion
- Cross-repository references need standardization

### Documentation Gaps
1. Order Management Terms
   - Missing order processing terminology
   - Missing order status definitions
   - Missing order flow descriptions

2. Customer Management Terms
   - Missing customer data model terms
   - Missing customer interaction terms
   - Missing privacy-related terms

3. Inventory Management Terms
   - Missing inventory tracking terms
   - Missing stock management terms
   - Missing synchronization terms

## Next Steps
