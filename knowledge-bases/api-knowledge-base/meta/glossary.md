# Knowledge Base Glossary

This document provides definitions for key terms used throughout The Peak Beyond's backend system documentation. Consistent use of terminology is essential for clear communication and effective AI agent processing.

## A

### API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. In The Peak Beyond's system, APIs enable communication between the backend, frontend, and third-party systems.

### Authentication
The process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity. The Peak Beyond's system uses JWT-based authentication for API access.

### Authorization
The process of determining whether an authenticated user has permission to access specific resources or perform specific actions.

## B

### Backend
The server-side component of The Peak Beyond's system, responsible for data processing, business logic, and API services.

### Batch Synchronization
A process where data is synchronized between systems in scheduled batches rather than in real-time.

## C

### CMS (Content Management System)
The system used to manage digital content for The Peak Beyond's kiosks, including product information, promotions, and media assets.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
A design pattern used to detect failures and prevent cascading failures in distributed systems by "tripping" when a certain threshold of failures is reached.

### Controller
A component in the MVC architecture that handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

## D

### Data Model
The structure and organization of data within The Peak Beyond's system, including entities, attributes, and relationships.

### Dispensary
A retail location that sells cannabis products, which is a primary client of The Peak Beyond's system.

### Dutchie
A cannabis e-commerce platform that integrates with The Peak Beyond's system.

## E

### Entity
A distinct object or concept within the system's data model, such as Store, Product, or Order.

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
A visual representation of the relationships between entities in a database.

## F

### Fallback Mechanism
A strategy implemented to provide alternative functionality when a primary system or component fails.

### Frontend
The client-side component of The Peak Beyond's system, including the user interface displayed on kiosks and web applications.

## I

### Incremental Synchronization
A data synchronization strategy that only transfers data that has changed since the last synchronization.

### Integration
The process of connecting different systems or components to work together as a unified whole.

## J

### JWT (JSON Web Token)
A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties, used for authentication in The Peak Beyond's system.

## K

### Kiosk
A self-service digital display unit installed in dispensaries, allowing customers to browse and order cannabis products.

## M

### Master Data
Common reference data shared across multiple tenants in a multi-tenant system, such as product information.

### Message Queue
A component that stores messages until they are processed by a receiving application, used for asynchronous communication between services.

### Model
A component in the MVC architecture that represents the data and business logic of the application.

### Multi-tenant Architecture
A software architecture where a single instance of the software serves multiple customers (tenants) while keeping their data isolated.

## O

### Order
A transaction representing a customer's purchase of products from a dispensary.

## P

### POS (Point of Sale)
A system used by dispensaries to process sales transactions and manage inventory.

### Prioritized Synchronization
A data synchronization strategy that prioritizes certain types of data over others based on business importance.

### Product
An item available for sale in a dispensary, represented in The Peak Beyond's system with attributes like name, description, and price.

### Product Variant
A specific version of a product with distinct attributes such as size, potency, or strain.

## R

### Rate Limiting
A strategy to control the amount of requests a user can make to an API within a given timeframe.

### Retry Logic
A mechanism that automatically retries failed operations according to a predefined strategy.

### Ruby on Rails
The web application framework used to build The Peak Beyond's backend system.

## S

### Serializer
A component that transforms complex data structures into formats suitable for transmission or storage.

### Store
A cannabis dispensary that uses The Peak Beyond's system, represented as a tenant in the multi-tenant architecture.

### StoreProduct
A representation of a master product within a specific store, including store-specific attributes like price and availability.

### StoreSync
The process of synchronizing data between a store's POS system and The Peak Beyond's CMS.

### StoreSyncItem
An individual item being synchronized during a StoreSync process.

## T

### Tenant
A customer organization whose data is isolated within a multi-tenant system. In The Peak Beyond's system, each dispensary is a tenant.

### Tenant Context
The current tenant scope within which operations are being performed in a multi-tenant system.

### Treez
A cannabis retail management platform that integrates with The Peak Beyond's system.

## W

### Webhook
A mechanism that allows one application to provide other applications with real-time information by sending HTTP POST requests when events occur.
