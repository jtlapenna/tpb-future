## Internal Link Structure Issues

### Anchor Links to Fix
The following files contain broken anchor references:
- /knowledge-base/functional/kiosk_management/appendix/kiosk_management_appendix.md
- /knowledge-base/reference/integration_documentation.md
- Multiple template files using "#" references

### Relative Path Issues
1. Authentication Documentation
   - Multiple references to "../../../authentication/README.md"
   - Recommendation: Standardize paths to use consistent relative references

2. API Documentation
   - Inconsistent references to API documentation across different directories
   - Recommendation: Create centralized API documentation reference structure

## Next Steps

1. External Links
   - [ ] Verify current status of RFID and kiosk design resources
   - [ ] Update Microsoft documentation links to new format
   - [ ] Confirm status of API client packages and update links

2. Internal Structure
