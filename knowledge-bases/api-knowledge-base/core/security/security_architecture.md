# The Peak Beyond - Security Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the security architecture of The Peak Beyond's platform, detailing the authentication and authorization mechanisms, security controls, and best practices implemented across the system.

## Core Security Components

### Authentication System
- **JWT-based Authentication**
  - Secure token-based authentication system
  - Tokens include user role and permissions
  - Configurable token expiration
  
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Optional second factor authentication
  - Supports various authentication methods
  - Planned integration with SSO systems

- **Account Security**
  - Password hashing using bcrypt
  - Account lockout after failed attempts
  - Password complexity requirements
  - Session management and timeout

### Authorization Framework

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **User Roles**
  1. System Administrator
     - Full system access
     - User management capabilities
     - System-wide configuration
  
  2. Store Manager
     - Store-level administration
     - Staff management
     - Store configuration
  
  3. Store Staff
     - Day-to-day operations
     - Limited administrative access
  
  4. API User
     - Programmatic access
     - Limited to specific endpoints

- **Permission System**
  - Granular permission definitions
  - Role-permission mapping
  - Hierarchical permission inheritance
  - Store-specific permission scoping

#### Authorization Implementation
- Pundit policies for authorization rules
- Controller-level authorization checks
- View-level permission enforcement
- API endpoint authorization

### Security Monitoring and Audit

#### Audit Logging
- Authentication events
- Authorization decisions
- User management actions
- Security-relevant operations

#### Security Monitoring
- Real-time security event monitoring
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Suspicious activity detection
- Security alert system

## Security Flows

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. System validates credentials
3. Optional MFA verification
4. JWT token generation
5. Token-based session management

### Authorization Flow
1. Request with JWT token
2. Token validation
3. Role/permission extraction
4. Policy-based authorization
5. Access control enforcement

## Security Best Practices

### Implementation Guidelines
- Secure password storage
- Token-based authentication
- Regular security audits
- Principle of least privilege
- Input validation and sanitization

### Security Headers
- CORS configuration
- CSP implementation
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Security Features
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration
- Enhanced MFA options
- Advanced audit logging
- Security analytics dashboard
