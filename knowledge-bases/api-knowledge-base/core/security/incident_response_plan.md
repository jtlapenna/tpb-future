# The Peak Beyond - Security Incident Response Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures and guidelines for responding to security incidents within The Peak Beyond's platform. It provides a structured approach to handling security breaches, vulnerabilities, and other security-related events.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

#### Level 1 - Critical
- Data breach involving customer PII
- System-wide authentication bypass
- Production database compromise
- Unauthorized admin access
- Active malicious code in production

#### Level 2 - High
- Failed brute force attempts
- Suspicious admin activities
- API key compromise
- Multiple failed MFA attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts to sensitive data

#### Level 3 - Medium
- Minor security misconfigurations
- Expired SSL certificates
- Non-critical policy violations
- Isolated failed login attempts
- Rate limit violations

#### Level 4 - Low
- Security patch updates needed
- Minor configuration issues
- Documentation discrepancies
- Non-sensitive log exposure
- Development environment issues

## Response Team Structure

### Primary Response Team
- Security Lead
- System Administrator
- Development Team Lead
- Database Administrator
- Communications Manager

### Extended Response Team
- Legal Counsel
- Human Resources
- Public Relations
- Customer Support Lead
- Compliance Officer

## Incident Response Procedures

### 1. Detection and Reporting
```ruby
# Example Security Event Monitoring
class SecurityMonitor
  def self.detect_incidents
    check_authentication_logs
    check_authorization_logs
    check_system_metrics
    check_database_activity
    check_api_usage
  end
  
  def self.report_incident(severity, details)
    incident = SecurityIncident.create!(
      severity: severity,
      details: details,
      detected_at: Time.current
    )
    notify_response_team(incident)
  end
end
```

### 2. Initial Assessment
- Determine incident severity
- Identify affected systems
- Assess potential impact
- Document initial findings
- Notify appropriate team members

### 3. Containment
```ruby
# Example Containment Actions
module IncidentContainment
  def self.emergency_lockdown
    # Disable affected user accounts
    affected_users.update_all(locked: true)
    
    # Revoke active sessions
    revoke_active_sessions
    
    # Enable enhanced monitoring
    enable_enhanced_monitoring
    
    # Block suspicious IPs
    block_suspicious_ips
  end
  
  def self.revoke_active_sessions
    JwtBlacklist.revoke_all(
      user_ids: affected_users.pluck(:id)
    )
  end
end
```

### 4. Investigation
- Analyze security logs
- Review system changes
- Identify entry points
- Document timeline
- Preserve evidence

### 5. Remediation
```ruby
# Example Remediation Actions
module IncidentRemediation
  def self.apply_security_fixes
    # Update security configurations
    update_security_configs
    
    # Apply emergency patches
    apply_emergency_patches
    
    # Reset affected credentials
    reset_affected_credentials
    
    # Update security rules
    update_security_rules
  end
  
  def self.verify_fixes
    run_security_tests
    verify_system_integrity
    check_unauthorized_changes
  end
end
```

### 6. Recovery
- Restore affected systems
- Verify system integrity
- Re-enable services
- Monitor for recurrence
- Update documentation

### 7. Post-Incident Analysis
```ruby
# Example Post-Incident Analysis
class IncidentAnalysis
  def self.generate_report(incident)
    {
      incident_id: incident.id,
      severity: incident.severity,
      timeline: create_timeline(incident),
      impact_assessment: assess_impact(incident),
      root_cause: determine_root_cause(incident),
      remediation_steps: document_remediation(incident),
      lessons_learned: identify_lessons(incident),
      recommendations: generate_recommendations(incident)
    }
  end
end
```

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
1. Initial Alert
   - Response team notification
   - Management briefing
   - Staff updates

2. Status Updates
   - Regular team briefings
   - Progress reports
   - Resolution confirmation

### External Communication
1. Customer Notification
   - Incident disclosure
   - Impact assessment
   - Remediation steps
   - Support contacts

2. Regulatory Reporting
   - Compliance requirements
   - Timeline documentation
   - Impact assessment
   - Remediation plan

## Prevention Measures

### Continuous Monitoring
```ruby
# Example Monitoring Configuration
class SecurityMonitoring
  def self.configure_alerts
    configure_authentication_alerts
    configure_authorization_alerts
    configure_system_alerts
    configure_database_alerts
  end
  
  def self.configure_authentication_alerts
    Alert.create_rule(
      name: 'failed_login_spike',
      condition: 'count > 10',
      period: 5.minutes,
      action: :notify_security_team
    )
  end
end
