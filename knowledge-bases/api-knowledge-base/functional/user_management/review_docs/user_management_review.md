## Technical Verification

### Core Components Verification

- [x] User Model (`app/models/user.rb`)
  - [x] Verify attributes and validations
    - Confirmed attributes: id, email, name, password_digest, active, created_at, updated_at, client_id
    - Validates presence and uniqueness of email
    - Validates password length (minimum 8 characters)
    - Validates password_confirmation presence unless password is blank
    - Uses has_secure_password for password hashing
  - [x] Verify associations with other models
    - Belongs to client (optional)
  - [x] Verify scopes and methods
    - `active` scope filters for active users
    - `from_token_payload` method for JWT authentication
    - `to_token_payload` method for JWT token generation
    - `admin?` method checks if client_id is blank

- [ ] Role Model
  - [ ] **Note**: No explicit Role model found in the codebase. The system appears to use a simpler authorization approach:
    - Users without a client_id are considered administrators
    - Users with a client_id are considered regular users
    - Authorization is handled through Pundit policies

- [ ] Permission Model
  - [ ] **Note**: No explicit Permission model found in the codebase. Permissions are implemented through Pundit policies.

- [x] User Controllers
  - [x] Verify `UsersController` endpoints
    - `current` action returns the current authenticated user
    - `index` action returns a paginated list of users (admin only)
    - `create` action creates a new user (admin only)
    - `update` action updates an existing user (admin or self)
    - `show` action returns a specific user (admin or self)
  - [x] Verify `UserTokenController` endpoints
    - `create` action generates a JWT token for authentication
  - [x] Verify parameter handling and validations
    - Uses Pundit's `permitted_attributes` for parameter filtering
    - Returns validation errors as JSON

- [ ] Role Controllers
  - [ ] **Note**: No explicit Role controllers found in the codebase.

- [x] Authentication Mechanism
  - [x] Verify JWT token generation and validation
    - Uses Knock gem for JWT authentication
    - Token lifetime set to 100 years in configuration
    - JWT payload includes user ID and audience
  - [x] Verify password hashing mechanism
    - Uses bcrypt via has_secure_password
  - [x] Verify login and logout functionality
    - Login via UserTokenController
    - No explicit logout (JWT tokens are stateless)

- [x] Authorization Mechanism
  - [x] Verify Pundit policies
    - ApplicationPolicy as base class
    - UserPolicy for user-specific authorization
    - Policy scopes for filtering accessible resources
  - [x] Verify permission checking logic
    - Admin users (without client_id) have full access
    - Regular users have limited access based on policies
  - [x] Verify role-based access control implementation
    - Simple role system: admin vs. regular users
    - No explicit role model, uses client_id presence

    - Supports pagination and sorting
    - Returns users array with pagination metadata

## Issues and Gaps

*Document any issues or gaps identified during the review process:*

1. The documentation describes a more complex role and permission system than what appears to be implemented in the codebase. The actual implementation uses a simpler approach:
   - Users without a client_id are considered administrators
   - Users with a client_id are considered regular users
   - Authorization is handled through Pundit policies

2. The documentation mentions UserRole and RolePermission join tables, but these don't appear to exist in the codebase.

3. The documentation describes a Permission model, but this doesn't appear to exist in the codebase. Permissions are implemented through Pundit policies.

4. The documentation mentions a user deletion process, but no explicit delete endpoint was found in the codebase.

5. The documentation describes more user attributes than are present in the actual User model.

## Recommendations for Improvement

*Document recommendations for improving the documentation:*

1. Update the User Roles section to reflect the simpler role system:
   - System Administrator (users without client_id)
   - Store Staff (users with client_id)

2. Simplify the Data Models section to reflect the actual models in the codebase:
   - User model with actual attributes
   - Remove Role, Permission, UserRole, and RolePermission models

3. Update the API Endpoints section to reflect the actual endpoints in the codebase:
   - Add GET /users/current endpoint
   - Remove any endpoints that don't exist

4. Update the Authorization Security section to reflect the actual implementation:
   - Simple role system based on client_id
   - Pundit policies for authorization

5. Update the User Management section to reflect the actual implementation:
   - No explicit user deletion process

## Notes

*Add any additional notes or comments here:*

The User Management Flow documentation should be updated to reflect the actual implementation in the codebase. The current documentation describes a more complex role and permission system than what is actually implemented. The actual implementation uses a simpler approach with just two roles (admin and regular users) and Pundit policies for authorization.
