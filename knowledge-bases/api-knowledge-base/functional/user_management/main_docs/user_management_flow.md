# User Management Flow

## Overview
The User Management Flow in The Peak Beyond's system handles the creation, authentication, authorization, and management of user accounts. This flow is essential for controlling access to the system, ensuring proper permissions, and maintaining security across the platform.

## User Roles

### System Administrator
- Creates and manages all user accounts
- Assigns roles and permissions
- Monitors user activity
- Manages system-wide security settings

### Store Manager
- Creates and manages store staff accounts
- Assigns store-specific roles and permissions
- Monitors store staff activity
- Manages store-specific security settings

### Store Staff
- Manages their own account information
- Has limited access based on assigned permissions
- Performs day-to-day operations within the system

### API User
- Programmatic access to specific API endpoints
- Limited to machine-to-machine interactions
- Has specific permissions for integration purposes

## Preconditions
1. Authentication system is properly configured
2. Role and permission models are defined
3. Security policies are established
4. Password requirements are configured
5. User data privacy requirements are addressed

## Core Flow Steps

### 1. User Creation
1. Administrator or Store Manager initiates user creation process
2. System presents user creation form
3. Required information is entered (name, email, role, etc.)
4. System validates the user data
5. System creates the user account
6. System assigns default permissions based on role
7. System sends account activation email
8. User completes account activation process

### 2. User Authentication
1. User navigates to login page
2. User enters credentials (email/username and password)
3. System validates credentials
4. System generates authentication token (JWT)
5. System logs successful login attempt
6. User is redirected to appropriate dashboard

### 3. User Authorization
1. User attempts to access a resource or perform an action
2. System checks user's role and permissions
3. System grants or denies access based on permissions
4. System logs authorization decision
5. User receives appropriate response (access or denial)

### 4. User Management
1. Administrator or Store Manager navigates to user management interface
2. System displays list of users based on access level
3. Administrator or Store Manager selects user to manage
4. System displays user details and available actions
5. Administrator or Store Manager performs desired action (edit, disable, delete)
6. System validates and processes the action
7. System confirms successful action

## Alternative Paths and Edge Cases

### Authentication Failures
- If credentials are invalid, system shows appropriate error message
- System logs failed login attempts
- After multiple failed attempts, system may lock the account
- System provides password reset functionality

### Authorization Failures
- If user lacks permission, system shows appropriate error message
- System logs unauthorized access attempts
- System may notify administrators of suspicious activity

### User Data Validation Failures
- If user data validation fails, system shows appropriate error messages
- User can correct the data and try again
- System logs validation failures for analysis

### Password Management
- System enforces password complexity requirements
- System provides secure password reset functionality
- System may require periodic password changes
- System securely stores password hashes, not plaintext passwords

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- JWT tokens are used for stateless authentication
- Token expiration is configured appropriately
- HTTPS is required for all authentication requests

### Authorization Security
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented
- Permissions are checked at both controller and model levels
- Pundit policies enforce authorization rules
- Least privilege principle is followed

### Data Protection
- User data is protected in transit and at rest
- Personal information is handled according to privacy regulations
- Access to user data is logged and audited
- Data retention policies are implemented

## Monitoring and Logging

- Authentication metrics are tracked (login frequency, failures, etc.)

### Authorization Monitoring
- Permission denials are logged
