# User Management Flow - Executive Summary

## Overview

The User Management Flow in The Peak Beyond's system provides a comprehensive solution for user authentication, authorization, and management. This document summarizes the key components and processes of the user management system.

## Key Components

### Authentication System

The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication via the Knock gem:
- Secure token-based authentication
- Stateless authentication flow
- Token lifetime set to 100 years in configuration
- Password hashing using bcrypt

### Authorization System

The system implements a simple but effective authorization approach:
- Two primary roles: System Administrator and Store Staff
- Role determination based on client_id presence
- Policy-based authorization using Pundit
- Resource isolation based on client association

### User Management

The system provides comprehensive user management capabilities:
- User creation (administrators only)
- User listing and filtering (administrators only)
- User profile viewing and editing
- Current user information retrieval

## Core Processes

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials to `/user_token` endpoint
2. System validates credentials and generates JWT token
3. Token is included in subsequent requests for authentication
4. No explicit logout (JWT tokens are stateless)

### User Creation Flow

1. Administrator creates user with email, password, and optional client_id
2. System validates input and creates user record
3. User role is determined by client_id presence
4. User can log in with provided credentials

### Authorization Flow

1. User makes request to protected endpoint
2. System validates JWT token and identifies user
3. Pundit policies determine if user is authorized
4. Access is granted or denied based on policy rules

## API Endpoints

The User Management Flow exposes the following key endpoints:

- `POST /user_token`: Authenticates user and returns JWT token
- `GET /users`: Lists all users (administrators only)
- `POST /users`: Creates a new user (administrators only)
- `GET /users/:id`: Retrieves a specific user
- `PUT /users/:id`: Updates a specific user
- `GET /users/current`: Retrieves the current user

## Security Considerations

The User Management Flow implements several security measures:
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT token validation on each request
- Policy-based authorization
- Resource isolation based on client association
- Detailed error handling without information leakage

## Integration Points

The User Management Flow integrates with:
- Frontend authentication and user management interfaces
- API authentication middleware
- Authorization policies across the system
- Client-based resource isolation

## Conclusion

The User Management Flow provides a secure and flexible system for managing users, authentication, and authorization. The simple role-based access control system, combined with policy-based authorization, ensures that users can only access resources they are authorized to view or modify.
