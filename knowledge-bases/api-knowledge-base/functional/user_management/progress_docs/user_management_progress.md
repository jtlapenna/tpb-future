## Current Completion: 100%

## Completed Tasks

- Created the main documentation directory structure
- Researched the User model implementation
- Researched the authorization implementation (Pundit policies)
- Researched the User controllers and endpoints
- Researched the authentication mechanism (JWT via Knock)
- Created the main documentation file with accurate information
- Created the executive summary
- Created the review document with technical verification findings
- Documented user roles and permissions
- Documented core flow steps with detailed sequence diagrams
- Documented alternative paths and error handling scenarios
- Documented API endpoints in detail with implementation details, request/response examples, and usage examples
- Documented API integration patterns
- Documented UI components with component structures, interactions, and example implementations
- Documented UI flow diagrams for authentication and user management
- Documented UI design considerations for responsive design, consistent styling, user feedback, accessibility, and performance
- Documented security considerations in detail
  - Authentication security (JWT implementation, password security)
  - Authorization security (role-based access control, permission granularity)
  - Data protection (sensitive data handling, database security)
  - API security (request validation, response security)
  - Audit and compliance (activity logging, compliance features)
  - Security testing (vulnerability scanning, security review process)
  - Security recommendations
- Created comprehensive review checklist with sections for:
  - Technical accuracy
  - Documentation completeness
  - Documentation quality
  - AI agent usability
  - Final verification
- Completed final review and verification
- Finalized documentation

## Pending Tasks

- None

## Blockers and Issues

- None at this time

## Next Steps

1. Maintain documentation as the system evolves
2. Consider implementing the security recommendations outlined in the documentation

## Notes

- The documentation has been updated to reflect the actual implementation in the codebase
- The system uses a simpler role system than initially expected (admin vs. regular users)
- Authorization is implemented through Pundit policies rather than explicit Role and Permission models
- JWT authentication is implemented via the Knock gem
- The token lifetime is set to 100 years, which may be a security concern
- Sequence diagrams have been added to illustrate the core flow steps
- API endpoints have been documented in detail with implementation details, request/response examples, and usage examples
- UI components have been documented with component structures, interactions, and example implementations
- The documentation follows the structure of the completed Customer Management Flow documentation
- The documentation focuses on authentication, authorization, and user management processes
- Technical verification has been performed to ensure accuracy and completeness
- Final review has been completed and all checklist items have been verified
