    - Accepts filtering parameters: catalog_id, first_name, last_name, phone, email, driver_license, birthday
    - Returns JSON with customers array
  - [x] Verify filtering and pagination
    - Filtering handled by POS client implementations
    - No explicit pagination in controller
  - [x] Verify authorization requirements
    - Requires valid client (POS integration)

- [x] `POST /api/v1/customers` - Create customer
  - [x] Verify required parameters
    - Requires customer object with first_name, last_name, gender, birthday, email, phone, drivers_license, notes
  - [x] Verify validation rules
    - Validation handled by POS client implementations
  - [x] Verify response format
    - Returns JSON with customer object
    - Status 201 (created) on success
  - [x] Verify error handling
    - Returns 405 (method not allowed) if client doesn't support creation

## Issues and Gaps

*Document any issues or gaps identified during the review process:*

1. The `CustomerSyncJob` is scheduled via the Store model, but the scheduling mechanism isn't explicitly documented. **ADDRESSED**: Added detailed documentation about the customer synchronization scheduling mechanism, including store-based scheduling, periodic scheduling, and uniqueness constraints.
2. The error handling in POS client implementations varies, which could lead to inconsistent behavior. **ADDRESSED**: Added comprehensive documentation of error handling strategies for each POS client implementation, including specific approaches for each client and global error handling mechanisms.
3. The `CustomerOrderController` and `OrdersController` handle customer orders but aren't fully integrated with the customer management flow documentation. **ADDRESSED**: Added a new section on the relationship with the Order Management Flow, detailing how customer data is used throughout the ordering process.

## Recommendations for Improvement

*Document recommendations for improving the documentation:*

1. Add more details about the scheduling mechanism for customer synchronization. **IMPLEMENTED**: Added detailed documentation about the customer synchronization scheduling mechanism.
2. Document the error handling strategies across different POS client implementations. **IMPLEMENTED**: Added comprehensive documentation of error handling strategies for each POS client.
3. Clarify the relationship between customer management and order management flows. **IMPLEMENTED**: Added a new section detailing the relationship between these flows.
4. Consider adding sequence diagrams to visualize the customer synchronization process.
5. Consider adding more examples of API requests and responses for the customer endpoints.
