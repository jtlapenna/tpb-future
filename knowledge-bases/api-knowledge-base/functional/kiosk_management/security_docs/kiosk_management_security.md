# Kiosk Management Security Considerations

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations for the kiosk management flow in The Peak Beyond's system. It covers authentication, authorization, data protection, API security, and physical security aspects to ensure the secure operation of kiosks in retail environments.

## Authentication

### User Authentication

The kiosk management system implements a robust authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access and manage kiosks.

**Implementation Details:**
- **JWT-based Authentication**: The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- **Token Expiration**: JWTs expire after 24 hours, requiring re-authentication
- **Refresh Token Mechanism**: Implements a secure refresh token mechanism to extend sessions
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Optional MFA for administrative accounts
- **Password Policies**: Enforces strong password requirements
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Password history enforcement (prevents reuse of last 5 passwords)
  - Maximum age of 90 days

**Security Measures:**
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks
- **Account Lockout**: Temporarily locks accounts after 5 failed login attempts
- **Session Invalidation**: Invalidates all sessions when password is changed
- **Secure Cookie Handling**: Uses secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management
- **IP Tracking**: Logs and monitors login attempts from unusual locations

### Kiosk Authentication

Kiosks themselves authenticate to the backend system to ensure only authorized kiosks can access the API.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Device Certificates**: Each kiosk is provisioned with a unique device certificate
- **API Keys**: Kiosks use dedicated API keys with limited permissions
- **Hardware Fingerprinting**: Additional verification based on hardware identifiers
- **Mutual TLS**: Implements mutual TLS authentication between kiosks and backend

**Security Measures:**
- **Certificate Rotation**: Automatic rotation of device certificates every 90 days
- **Revocation Mechanism**: Ability to immediately revoke access for compromised kiosks
- **Heartbeat Verification**: Regular verification of kiosk authenticity through heartbeat signals
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitoring for unusual access patterns or locations

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements a comprehensive RBAC model to ensure users can only perform actions appropriate to their role.

**User Roles:**
- **System Administrator**: Full access to all kiosk management functions across all stores
- **Store Manager**: Full access to kiosk management for their assigned stores
- **Content Manager**: Limited to content and layout configuration for assigned stores
- **Staff**: View-only access to kiosk information for their store
- **Kiosk**: Limited API access for frontend operations

**Permission Structure:**
- **Kiosk Creation**: Limited to System Administrators and Store Managers
- **Kiosk Configuration**: Available to System Administrators, Store Managers, and Content Managers
- **Kiosk Deletion**: Limited to System Administrators and Store Managers
- **Product Association**: Available to System Administrators, Store Managers, and Content Managers
- **RFID Configuration**: Limited to System Administrators and Store Managers
- **Layout Editing**: Available to System Administrators, Store Managers, and Content Managers
- **Settings Management**: Limited to System Administrators and Store Managers

**Implementation Details:**
- **Policy Objects**: Uses Pundit policies to enforce authorization rules
- **Attribute-Based Access Control**: Additional restrictions based on store association
- **Permission Inheritance**: Hierarchical permission structure
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Users are granted minimum permissions needed for their role

### Store-Based Isolation

The system enforces strict isolation between stores to prevent unauthorized access to data.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Data is logically separated by store
- **Store Association Validation**: All kiosk operations validate store association
- **Cross-store Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to kiosks from different stores
- **Audit Logging**: Records all cross-store access attempts

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

The kiosk management system handles various types of sensitive data that require protection.

**Types of Sensitive Data:**
- **User Credentials**: Authentication information for system users
- **API Keys**: Keys used for system integration and kiosk authentication
- **Customer Information**: Limited customer data that may be displayed on kiosks
- **Business Configuration**: Proprietary business rules and configurations
- **RFID Tag Identifiers**: Unique identifiers for physical products

**Protection Measures:**
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data is encrypted in the database
- **Encryption in Transit**: All communications use TLS 1.3
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is stored and transmitted
- **Tokenization**: Sensitive identifiers are tokenized when possible
- **Secure Key Management**: Hardware Security Module (HSM) for cryptographic key storage

### Data Retention and Deletion

The system implements policies for appropriate data retention and secure deletion.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Retention Policies**: Defines how long different types of data are retained
- **Secure Deletion**: Implements secure wiping of sensitive data
- **Archiving**: Automated archiving of historical configuration data
- **Kiosk Decommissioning**: Process for securely removing all data when a kiosk is decommissioned

## API Security

### API Endpoint Protection

The kiosk management API implements multiple layers of security to protect against common attacks.

**Security Measures:**
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all API inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding of all API responses
- **CSRF Protection**: Implements anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts sources of executable content
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through request rate limiting
  - 100 requests per minute per API token
  - 5,000 requests per day per API token
- **Request Signing**: Critical operations require request signing

### Vulnerability Prevention

The system is designed to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

**Protection Against:**
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **XSS Attacks**: Content Security Policy and output encoding
- **CSRF Attacks**: Anti-CSRF tokens and same-site cookies
- **SSRF Attacks**: URL validation and restricted internal network access
- **Broken Authentication**: Secure session management and token handling
- **Insecure Direct Object References**: Resource authorization checks
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Hardened default configurations

## Physical Kiosk Security

### Hardware Security

Physical kiosks require specific security measures to protect against tampering and unauthorized access.

**Security Measures:**
- **Tamper-Evident Seals**: Physical seals that show evidence of tampering
- **Locked Enclosures**: Secure physical enclosures for kiosk hardware
- **Kiosk Mode**: Operating system locked in kiosk mode to prevent access to underlying system
- **Boot Protection**: Secure boot process with integrity verification
- **Storage Encryption**: Full-disk encryption for kiosk storage
- **Physical Port Protection**: USB and other ports are physically secured or disabled

### RFID Security

RFID functionality introduces additional security considerations.

**Security Measures:**
- **Tag Authentication**: Verification of RFID tag authenticity
- **Signal Encryption**: Encryption of RFID communication when supported
- **Limited Read Range**: Configured to minimize unauthorized scanning
- **Tag Data Minimization**: Only necessary data stored on RFID tags
- **Anti-collision Protocols**: Prevents tag collision attacks

## Monitoring and Incident Response

**Response Process:**
1. **Detection**: Automated and manual processes to detect incidents
2. **Containment**: Immediate actions to limit impact (e.g., kiosk deactivation)
3. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis and impact assessment
4. **Remediation**: Addressing the underlying vulnerability
5. **Recovery**: Restoring normal operations
6. **Post-incident Review**: Learning from incidents to improve security

## Compliance Considerations
