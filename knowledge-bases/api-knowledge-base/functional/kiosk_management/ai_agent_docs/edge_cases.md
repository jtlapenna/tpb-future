**Handling**:
1. Kiosk continues to function with cached data
2. UI displays offline indicator in the status bar
3. Orders are stored locally in browser storage
4. RFID scans are logged but not processed
5. Periodic connection retry with exponential backoff (starting at 5 seconds, doubling up to 5 minutes)

**Recovery**:
1. Automatic reconnection when network is available
2. Data synchronization in background
3. Notification to user when connection is restored
4. Processing of queued orders and RFID scans
5. Conflict resolution for any data modified while offline

**Prevention**:
1. Implement robust caching strategies
2. Use service workers for offline functionality
3. Configure fallback content for critical features
4. Implement local storage for temporary data

### Network Failure During Kiosk Configuration

## Data-Related Edge Cases

### Product Synchronization Failure

**Scenario**: Products fail to synchronize from POS to kiosk due to API errors or data inconsistencies.

**Impact**:
- Outdated product information displayed to customers
- Potential pricing discrepancies
- Missing new products or continued display of discontinued products

**Handling**:
1. Continue using last known good product data
2. Display last sync timestamp to indicate potentially outdated information
3. Log synchronization failure with details
4. Implement partial sync for critical updates (e.g., price changes)
5. Retry synchronization with exponential backoff

**Recovery**:
1. Manual trigger for synchronization from CMS
2. Incremental sync to reduce data transfer
3. Notification to store manager if sync fails repeatedly
4. Fallback to basic product display if extended attributes fail to sync

**Prevention**:
1. Implement robust error handling in sync process
2. Use data validation before accepting updates
3. Implement conflict resolution strategies
4. Schedule regular full synchronization during off-hours

### Invalid RFID Tag Detection

**Scenario**: RFID tag is read but not recognized in the system or associated with the wrong product.

**Impact**:
- Customer confusion when scanning physical product
- Potential display of incorrect product information
- Reduced trust in the kiosk system

**Handling**:
1. Display friendly error message explaining the issue
2. Log unrecognized tag ID for later association
3. Provide option to browse products manually
4. Suggest contacting store staff for assistance
5. Offer barcode scanning as alternative if available

**Recovery**:
1. Store staff can associate the tag with a product in the CMS
2. System will recognize the tag on subsequent scans
3. Periodic cleanup of unrecognized tag logs
4. Batch processing of tag associations

**Prevention**:
1. Implement tag validation during product setup
2. Regular audit of RFID tag associations
3. Staff training on proper tag programming
4. Implement tag testing station for verification

## Authentication and Security Edge Cases

### Kiosk Authentication Failure

**Scenario**: Kiosk fails to authenticate with the backend due to expired credentials or system issues.

**Impact**:
- Inability to access backend services
- Limited functionality
- Potential security vulnerabilities if fallbacks are insecure

**Handling**:
