## Verification Notes

All diagrams are properly referenced in the text and all elements within the diagrams are explained in the corresponding documentation. The cross-references between diagrams and text are complete and accurate.

## Recommendations

1. Add direct hyperlinks from text references to the corresponding diagrams for improved navigation
2. Consider adding figure numbers to diagrams for easier reference
3. Add a list of figures at the beginning of each document that contains diagrams
