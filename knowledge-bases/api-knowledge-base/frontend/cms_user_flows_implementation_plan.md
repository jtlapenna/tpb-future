# CMS User Flows Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for documenting the Content Management System (CMS) user flows for The Peak Beyond. The CMS is an admin-facing Angular application that allows dispensary staff to manage products, pricing, promotions, and integrations. Documenting these flows is critical for understanding how administrators interact with the system and for future development efforts.

## Goals

1. Document all key user flows in the CMS application
2. Map components used in each flow
3. Document API interactions for each flow
4. Identify edge cases and error states
5. Create visual diagrams of flows

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Preparation (1-2 days)

1. **Identify CMS Repository**
   - Locate the Angular CMS repository
   - Obtain access permissions
   - Clone repository locally

2. **Analyze CMS Structure**
   - Identify main modules
   - Map routing configuration
   - Understand authentication flow
   - Identify key services and components

3. **Set Up Documentation Environment**
   - Create documentation templates
   - Set up diagram creation tools
   - Prepare component mapping spreadsheet

### Phase 2: User Flow Identification (2-3 days)

1. **Identify Primary User Flows**
   - Authentication flows (login, logout, password reset)
   - Product management flows (create, edit, delete products)
   - Inventory management flows
   - Promotion management flows
   - User management flows
   - Reporting and analytics flows
   - Configuration and settings flows

2. **Prioritize User Flows**
   - Rank flows by importance and frequency of use
   - Identify dependencies between flows
   - Create documentation schedule

3. **Create User Flow Inventory**
   - Document name and purpose of each flow
   - Identify entry points and exit points
   - Note expected outcomes
   - List stakeholders and user roles

### Phase 3: User Flow Documentation (5-7 days)

For each identified user flow:

1. **Document Flow Steps**
   - Identify starting point and trigger
   - Document each step in sequence
   - Note user interactions and system responses
   - Document completion criteria

2. **Map Components**
   - Identify components used in each step
   - Document component hierarchy
   - Note component interactions
   - Map state changes

3. **Document API Interactions**
   - Identify API endpoints called
   - Document request parameters
   - Document response handling
   - Note error handling

4. **Identify Edge Cases**
   - Document alternative paths
   - Identify error states
   - Document recovery mechanisms
   - Note performance considerations

5. **Create Flow Diagrams**
   - Create sequence diagrams
   - Create state diagrams
   - Create component interaction diagrams
   - Create user journey maps

### Phase 4: Validation and Refinement (2-3 days)

1. **Review Documentation**
   - Check for completeness
   - Verify accuracy
   - Ensure consistency
   - Check cross-references

2. **Validate with Stakeholders**
   - Review with frontend developers
   - Gather feedback
   - Identify gaps
   - Note improvement opportunities

3. **Refine Documentation**
   - Address feedback
   - Fill gaps
   - Improve clarity
   - Enhance diagrams

4. **Finalize Documentation**
   - Format consistently
   - Add metadata
   - Create index
   - Update cross-references

## Resources Needed

1. **Access to CMS Repository**
   - Git access
   - Build environment
   - Running instance for testing

2. **Documentation Tools**
   - Markdown editor
   - Diagram creation tool (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart)
   - Screenshot tool

3. **Stakeholder Availability**
   - Frontend developers for validation
   - Product manager for flow verification
   - QA team for edge case identification

## Success Criteria

The CMS User Flows documentation will be considered successful when:

1. All key user flows are documented with clear steps
2. Each flow includes component mappings and API interactions
3. Edge cases and error states are identified and documented
4. Visual diagrams are created for each flow
5. Documentation is validated with frontend developers
6. Documentation is accessible and useful to developers

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Limited access to CMS codebase | High | Medium | Request access early, use available documentation to start |
| Incomplete understanding of flows | High | Medium | Validate with developers, test flows in running instance |
| Complex flows difficult to document | Medium | High | Break down into smaller sub-flows, focus on one component at a time |
| Changes to CMS during documentation | Medium | Low | Establish version control, note changes as they occur |
| Insufficient stakeholder availability | High | Medium | Schedule validation sessions in advance, provide clear expectations |

## Next Steps

1. Request access to CMS repository
2. Set up documentation environment
3. Begin analysis of CMS structure
4. Create and validate user flow inventory
5. Begin documentation of highest priority flows
