# CMS User Management Flows Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for documenting user management flows in The Peak Beyond's CMS application. User management is a critical aspect of the CMS, enabling administrators to control access, assign permissions, and manage user accounts. Comprehensive documentation of these flows will ensure proper implementation, maintenance, and onboarding of new developers.

## User Management Flows to Document

| Flow | Priority | Estimated Effort | Dependencies | Target Completion |
|------|----------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| User Creation Flow | High | 2-3 hours | None | 2023-08-03 |
| User Editing Flow | High | 2-3 hours | User Creation Flow | 2023-08-04 |
| User Permissions Management Flow | High | 3-4 hours | User Creation Flow | 2023-08-05 |
| Password Reset Flow | Medium | 2-3 hours | User Creation Flow | 2023-08-06 |

## Flow Descriptions

### 1. User Creation Flow

**Description**: Documents the process for creating new user accounts in the CMS, including setting initial roles, permissions, and account details.

**Key Aspects to Document**:
- User roles and their default permissions
- Required and optional user information
- Validation rules for user data
- Email verification process
- Initial password setting
- Store/location assignment
- Security considerations

### 2. User Editing Flow

**Description**: Documents the process for modifying existing user accounts, including updating personal information, contact details, and account status.

**Key Aspects to Document**:
- Editable user properties
- Validation rules for updates
- Account status management (active, inactive, suspended)
- Email notification for significant changes
- Audit logging of changes
- Self-service profile editing vs. admin editing

### 3. User Permissions Management Flow

**Description**: Documents the process for assigning, modifying, and revoking user permissions and roles.

**Key Aspects to Document**:
- Role-based permission system
- Custom permission assignments
- Permission inheritance and overrides
- Store/location-specific permissions
- Permission groups and templates
- Permission audit and review process
- Security implications of permission changes

### 4. Password Reset Flow

**Description**: Documents the process for resetting user passwords, both self-service and administrator-initiated.

**Key Aspects to Document**:
- Self-service password reset
- Admin-initiated password reset
- Secure reset link generation and expiration
- Password strength requirements
- Multi-factor authentication considerations
- Account lockout and security measures
- Password history and reuse policies

## Documentation Structure

Each user management flow documentation will follow the established template and include:

1. **Overview**: Purpose and importance of the flow
2. **User Roles**: Who can perform these actions
3. **Preconditions**: Requirements before starting the flow
4. **Flow Steps**: Detailed step-by-step process
5. **Alternative Paths**: Variations of the main flow
6. **Edge Cases**: Unusual scenarios and their handling
7. **Error States**: Possible errors and their handling
8. **Performance Considerations**: Optimization strategies
9. **Related Flows**: Links to related documentation
10. **Components Used**: UI components involved
11. **API Endpoints Used**: Backend services utilized
12. **Diagrams**: Visual representations of the flow
13. **Security Considerations**: Security aspects and best practices
14. **Testing**: Test cases for validation

## Implementation Approach

1. **Research Phase** (0.5-1 hour per flow)
   - Review existing documentation
   - Identify key components and API endpoints
   - Understand security requirements
   - Identify edge cases and error states

2. **Documentation Creation** (1.5-2 hours per flow)
   - Write comprehensive flow documentation
   - Create sequence and state diagrams
   - Document API endpoints and components
   - Document security considerations

3. **Review and Refinement** (0.5-1 hour per flow)
   - Review for completeness and accuracy
   - Ensure consistency with other documentation
   - Add cross-references to related flows
   - Update progress tracking documents

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies

- Understanding of role-based access control implementation
- Knowledge of user data model and validation rules
- Information about email notification system
- Understanding of security requirements and compliance needs

### Risks

- Incomplete information about actual implementation details
- Security-sensitive information that may need to be handled carefully
- Complex permission structures that may be difficult to document clearly
- Integration with external authentication systems

## Success Criteria

1. Complete documentation of all four user management flows
2. Clear explanation of security considerations and best practices
3. Comprehensive coverage of edge cases and error states
4. Accurate representation of the actual implementation (to the extent possible)
5. Consistency with other CMS flow documentation

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked in the CMS User Flows Documentation Progress document, with updates after each flow is completed.
