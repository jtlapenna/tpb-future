# CMS Order Management Flow Documentation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for documenting the Order Management flows in The Peak Beyond's Content Management System (CMS). Order management is a critical aspect of the dispensary operations, allowing staff to view, process, and manage customer orders through the CMS.

## Key Flows to Document

1. **Order List View Flow**
   - Viewing all orders
   - Filtering and searching orders
   - Sorting orders
   - Pagination and navigation

2. **Order Detail View Flow**
   - Viewing order details
   - Viewing customer information
   - Viewing product information
   - Viewing payment information
   - Viewing order status history

3. **Order Status Update Flow**
   - Changing order status (e.g., pending, processing, completed, cancelled)
   - Adding notes to order
   - Triggering notifications

4. **Order Fulfillment Flow**
   - Marking items as prepared
   - Generating receipts
   - Processing payment
   - Completing order

5. **Order Cancellation Flow**
   - Cancelling an order
   - Refunding payment (if applicable)
   - Updating inventory

## Documentation Structure

Each flow will be documented following the established template, including:

1. **Overview**: Purpose and importance of the flow
2. **User Roles**: Which roles can perform actions in this flow
3. **Preconditions**: Requirements before the flow can begin
4. **Flow Steps**: Detailed steps with components, states, API calls, user interactions, and system responses
5. **Alternative Paths**: Common variations of the main flow
6. **Edge Cases**: Unusual scenarios and how they're handled
7. **Error States**: Potential errors and their handling
8. **Performance Considerations**: Optimization strategies
9. **Related Flows**: Links to related documentation
10. **Components Used**: List of components involved
11. **API Endpoints Used**: List of endpoints used
12. **Diagrams**: Sequence and state diagrams
13. **Security Considerations**: Security measures
14. **Testing**: Test cases for validation

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Phase**
   - Gather information about order management in dispensary operations
   - Identify common patterns in e-commerce order management
   - Understand specific requirements for cannabis dispensaries

2. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document Order List View Flow
   - Document Order Detail View Flow
   - Document Order Status Update Flow
   - Document Order Fulfillment Flow
   - Document Order Cancellation Flow

3. **Review Phase**
   - Review documentation for completeness
   - Validate with available information
   - Identify areas requiring further clarification
