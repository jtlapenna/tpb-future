# CMS Order List View Flow

## Overview

The Order List View Flow allows dispensary staff to view, filter, and manage all customer orders through The Peak Beyond's Content Management System (CMS). This flow provides a comprehensive overview of all orders placed through the kiosk system, enabling staff to monitor order status, identify trends, and efficiently manage the fulfillment process. The list view serves as the entry point to more detailed order management functions.

## User Roles

- **Admin**: Can view all orders across all stores
- **Store Manager**: Can view all orders for their assigned store(s)
- **Order Fulfillment Staff**: Can view orders for their assigned store(s)
- **Reporting User**: Can view orders but cannot modify them

## Preconditions

- User is authenticated in the CMS
- User has appropriate permissions to view orders
- Store has at least one order in the system (otherwise, an empty state is displayed)
- User has network connectivity to access the CMS

## Flow Steps

1. **Navigate to Orders Section**
   - Components: SidebarComponent, NavigationComponent
   - State: Initial application state
   - API Calls: None (navigation only)
   - User Interaction: User clicks on "Orders" in the sidebar navigation
   - System Response: System navigates to the orders list page

2. **Load Orders List**
   - Components: OrderListComponent, LoadingIndicatorComponent
   - State: Loading state
   - API Calls: GET `/api/v1/orders` (with pagination parameters)
   - User Interaction: None (automatic)
   - System Response: System displays loading indicator while fetching orders

3. **Display Orders List**
   - Components: OrderListComponent, OrderRowComponent, PaginationComponent
   - State: Orders list loaded
   - API Calls: None (data already loaded)
   - User Interaction: None (automatic)
   - System Response: System displays the list of orders with key information:
     - Order ID/Number
     - Customer name
     - Order date/time
     - Total amount
     - Status (Pending, Processing, Completed, Cancelled)
     - Payment method
     - Actions (View, Process, etc.)

4. **Filter Orders**
   - Components: FilterComponent, DateRangePickerComponent, StatusFilterComponent, SearchComponent
   - State: Orders list with filter controls
   - API Calls: GET `/api/v1/orders` (with filter parameters)
   - User Interaction: User selects filter criteria:
     - Date range
     - Order status
     - Customer name/email
     - Order ID
   - System Response: System updates the orders list based on filter criteria

5. **Sort Orders**
   - Components: OrderListComponent, SortControlComponent
   - State: Orders list with sort controls
   - API Calls: GET `/api/v1/orders` (with sort parameters)
   - User Interaction: User clicks on column headers or sort controls
   - System Response: System updates the orders list based on sort criteria

6. **Paginate Orders**
   - Components: PaginationComponent
   - State: Orders list with pagination controls
   - API Calls: GET `/api/v1/orders` (with pagination parameters)
   - User Interaction: User clicks on pagination controls
   - System Response: System loads and displays the selected page of orders

7. **Select Order for Detailed View**
   - Components: OrderRowComponent, ActionButtonComponent
   - State: Orders list with selectable rows
   - API Calls: None (navigation only)
   - User Interaction: User clicks on an order row or "View" button
   - System Response: System navigates to the Order Detail View for the selected order

8. **Perform Bulk Actions**
   - Components: BulkActionComponent, CheckboxComponent, ConfirmationModalComponent
   - State: Orders list with selectable rows
   - API Calls: Varies based on action (e.g., POST `/api/v1/orders/bulk_update`)
   - User Interaction: User selects multiple orders using checkboxes, chooses a bulk action, and confirms
   - System Response: System performs the selected action on all selected orders and updates the list

## Alternative Paths

### A1. Empty Orders List

If no orders match the current filters or the store has no orders:

1. System displays an empty state message
2. System provides guidance on how to proceed (e.g., adjust filters, check POS system)

### A2. Export Orders

If the user wants to export the orders list:

1. User clicks "Export" button
2. System displays export options (CSV, PDF, Excel)
3. User selects export format
4. System generates and downloads the export file

### A3. Quick Status Update

If the user wants to quickly update an order's status:

1. User clicks on the status dropdown in the order row
2. System displays available status options
3. User selects a new status
4. System updates the order status without leaving the list view

## Edge Cases

| Edge Case | Handling |
|-----------|----------|
| Large number of orders | Implement pagination and optimize query performance |
| No orders match filters | Display user-friendly empty state with suggestions |
| Network connectivity issues | Implement retry mechanism and offline indicators |
| Orders from multiple stores (for admin) | Clearly indicate store information in the list |
| Orders with special requirements | Highlight or flag orders requiring special attention |
| Partially synced orders from POS | Indicate sync status and provide refresh option |
| Orders with discrepancies | Flag orders with pricing or inventory discrepancies |

## Error States

| Error | Handling |
|-------|----------|
| API failure when loading orders | Display error message with retry option |
| Unauthorized access | Redirect to login or display permission error |
| Filter combination returns too many results | Suggest refining filters or implement server-side pagination |
| Session timeout during browsing | Preserve filter state and prompt for re-authentication |
| Sorting/filtering with invalid parameters | Fallback to default sorting/filtering |

## Performance Considerations

1. **Pagination**: Implement server-side pagination to handle large datasets
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load order details only when needed
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed order data
4. **Optimized Queries**: Use indexed fields for filtering and sorting
5. **Debounced Search**: Implement debouncing for search inputs to reduce API calls
6. **Virtual Scrolling**: Consider virtual scrolling for very large lists
7. **Background Refreshing**: Periodically refresh data in the background

## Security Considerations

1. **Permission Checks**: Ensure users can only view orders they have permission to access
2. **Data Filtering**: Filter sensitive customer information based on user role
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all order view and filter actions for audit purposes
4. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for all form submissions
5. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all filter inputs to prevent injection attacks
6. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Testing

| Filter by Date | Apply date range filter | Only orders within date range displayed |
| Filter by Status | Apply status filter | Only orders with selected status displayed |
| Search by Customer | Search for customer name | Only matching orders displayed |
| Sort Orders | Sort by different columns | Orders sorted correctly |
| Pagination | Navigate between pages | Correct page of orders displayed |
| Select Order | Click on an order | Navigate to order detail view |
| Bulk Action | Select multiple orders and apply action | Action applied to all selected orders |
| Empty State | Apply filters with no matching results | Empty state displayed with guidance |
