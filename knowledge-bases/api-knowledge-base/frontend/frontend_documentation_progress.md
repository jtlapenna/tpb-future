## In Progress Documentation

No items currently in progress.

## Blockers

1. **Limited access to frontend codebase**: Cannot document actual implementation details
2. **Limited input from frontend developers**: Cannot validate assumptions about component design decisions
3. **Limited access to design assets**: Cannot document UI/UX patterns in detail

## Next Steps

1. **Document User Management Flows**
   - Create User Management Implementation Plan
   - Begin User Management Flows documentation
   - Focus on User Creation Flow first

2. **Document core frontend components**
   - Create component inventory based on available information
   - Document key UI components using the component documentation template

3. **Enhance architecture documentation**
   - Document build and deployment pipeline
   - Document error handling strategies
   - Document performance optimization strategies
