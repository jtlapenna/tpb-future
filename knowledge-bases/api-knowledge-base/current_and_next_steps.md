# Current and Next Steps

## Overview

The Knowledge Base Implementation project for The Peak Beyond is currently in Phase 3: Frontend Documentation. This phase is now 41.2% complete, with significant progress made in documenting CMS user flows, particularly Product Management and Order Management flows, which are now 100% complete. We have also created a User Management Implementation Plan and started work on the User Creation Flow documentation.

## Completed Phases

- **Phase 1: API Documentation** (100% complete)
  - Documented all API endpoints with request/response formats
  - Created authentication documentation
  - Documented data models and relationships

- **Phase 2: Backend-Frontend Integration** (100% complete)
  - Documented real-time communication mechanisms
  - Created integration patterns documentation
  - Documented authentication flow between frontend and backend

## Current Phase

- **Phase 3: Frontend Documentation** (41.2% complete)
  - Created frontend architecture overview
  - Documented state management approach
  - Created component documentation template
  - Documented CMS login flow
  - Documented CMS product management flows (creation, editing, deletion)
  - Documented CMS order management flows (list view, detail view, status update, fulfillment, cancellation)
  - Created User Management Implementation Plan

## Current Task

- ðŸ”„ **Document User Creation Flow**
  - Create flow overview and user roles
  - Document preconditions and flow steps
  - Document alternative paths and edge cases
  - Add API endpoints and components used
  - Add security considerations and testing

## Immediate Next Steps (After Current Task)

1. **Document User Editing Flow**
   - Create flow overview and user roles
   - Document preconditions and flow steps
   - Document alternative paths and edge cases
   - Add API endpoints and components used

2. **Document User Permissions Management Flow**
   - Create flow overview and user roles
   - Document preconditions and flow steps
   - Document alternative paths and edge cases
   - Add API endpoints and components used

3. **Document Password Reset Flow**
   - Create flow overview and user roles
   - Document preconditions and flow steps
   - Document alternative paths and edge cases
   - Add API endpoints and components used

## Resources Needed

1. **Frontend Codebase Access**: To document actual implementation details
2. **Input from Frontend Developers**: To validate assumptions and document architectural decisions
3. **Access to Design Assets**: To document UI/UX patterns

## Challenges and Risks

1. **Limited Frontend Codebase Access**: Currently documenting based on available information, which may lead to gaps
2. **Evolving Requirements**: The system is actively being developed, which may require documentation updates
3. **Technical Debt**: Existing undocumented areas may be difficult to document accurately
4. **Technical Issues**: Experiencing some technical issues with documentation tools

## Success Criteria

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All key aspects of the system are documented
2. **Developer Onboarding**: New developers can understand the system quickly
3. **Maintainability**: Documentation is easy to update and maintain
4. **Accessibility**: Documentation is easily accessible to all stakeholders
