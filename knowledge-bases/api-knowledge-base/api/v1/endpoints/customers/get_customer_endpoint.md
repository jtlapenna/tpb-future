# Get Customer

## Overview

Based on the analysis of the codebase, there doesn't appear to be a dedicated endpoint for retrieving a single customer by its ID. The API only supports listing customers with filters and creating new customers. This documentation outlines the current limitations and provides guidance on alternative approaches.

## Current Limitations

The API routes for customers are limited to:
- `GET /api/v1/:catalog_id/customers` (List Customers)
- `POST /api/v1/:catalog_id/customers` (Create Customer)

There is no `GET /api/v1/:catalog_id/customers/:id` endpoint for retrieving a specific customer.

## Alternative Approaches

### Using the List Customers Endpoint with Filters

The most effective alternative is to use the List Customers endpoint with specific filters to narrow down the results to a single customer. This can be done by filtering on unique identifiers such as email, phone number, or driver's license.

```
GET /api/v1/:catalog_id/customers?email=john.doe@example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

This approach should return a list containing only the customer with the specified email address, assuming the email is unique in the system.

### Filtering by Multiple Criteria

For more precise filtering, you can combine multiple criteria:

```
GET /api/v1/:catalog_id/customers?first_name=John&last_name=Doe&phone=5551234567
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

This approach increases the likelihood of finding a specific customer, especially if no single attribute is guaranteed to be unique.

### Direct POS System Integration

For applications requiring direct customer lookup by ID, it may be necessary to integrate directly with the POS system's API rather than using this backend as an intermediary. Each POS system has its own API for customer management, which typically includes functionality to retrieve a customer by ID.

## Implementation Details

### Controller

- **File**: `app/controllers/api/v1/customers_controller.rb`
- **Methods**: Only `index` and `create` are implemented; there is no `show` method.

### Models

- **Primary Model**: `Customer`
  - Stores customer information including name, contact details, and identification
  - Belongs to a store
  - Validates presence of customer_id

## Common Use Cases and Workarounds

1. **Customer Profile Viewing**: To view a specific customer's profile, consider:
   - Using the List Customers endpoint with specific filters
   - Caching customer information after retrieval for faster access
   - Implementing a custom endpoint in your application

2. **Order Processing**: For retrieving customer information during order processing:
   - Use the List Customers endpoint with filters
   - Store the customer ID after customer creation or lookup
   - Use the customer ID in subsequent order creation requests

3. **Customer Verification**: For verifying customer identity:
   - Use the List Customers endpoint with driver's license or other identification
   - Implement additional verification logic in your application

## Notes for AI Agents

### Documentation Agent
- Note that there is no dedicated endpoint for retrieving a single customer
- Cross-reference with related endpoints to maintain consistency

### Customer Management Agent
- Be aware that direct customer lookup by ID is not supported through this API
- Use the List Customers endpoint with filters as an alternative
- Consider caching customer information for frequently accessed customers

### Integration Agent
- Direct integration with the POS system may be necessary for customer lookup by ID
- The filtering capabilities of the List Customers endpoint vary by POS system
- Consider implementing a custom lookup mechanism if direct customer retrieval is essential

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

1. **Missing Get Functionality**: The API lacks a dedicated endpoint for retrieving a single customer by ID
2. **Inefficient Lookup**: Using filters on the List Customers endpoint is less efficient than direct ID lookup
3. **Limited Customer Management**: The API provides limited customer management capabilities
4. **Potential Performance Issues**: Filtering through potentially large customer lists could lead to performance issues
