- [x] Data Flow Architecture
  - [x] Verify POS to CMS to Backend to Kiosk flow
    - Inventory and product information originates in the POS system
    - CMS pulls data from the POS and allows dispensary staff to manage it
    - Backend syncs the latest product and pricing updates from the CMS to the kiosks
    - Frontend (Kiosk UI) fetches data from the backend, ensuring real-time availability
  - [x] Verify Kiosk to Backend to POS flow
    - Customers browse and add items to their cart via the Kiosk UI
    - When an order is placed, the frontend sends the request to the backend
    - Backend validates the order and forwards it to the POS system for processing
    - POS confirms the order, and the Backend logs it for tracking and analytics
  - [x] Verify NFC/RFID interaction flow
    - When a customer taps an NFC-enabled product on the kiosk, the NFC reader retrieves the product ID
    - The kiosk sends the ID to the CMS, which returns product details
    - The UI instantly updates to display relevant product information
    - RFID detects when an item is lifted or placed near the sensor

- [x] Database Architecture
  - [x] Verify entity relationships
    - Store to StoreProduct: One-to-many. A store has many store products.

    - Store to Kiosk: One-to-many. A store has many kiosks.
    - Store to Customer: One-to-many. A store has many customers.
    - Store to Order: One-to-many. A store has many orders.
    - Product to ProductVariant: One-to-many. A product has many variants.
    - Product to StoreProduct: One-to-many. A product can exist in many stores.
    - Order to OrderItem: One-to-many. An order has many items.
  - [x] Verify multi-tenant implementation
    - Stores are the primary tenant entities
    - Each store has its own isolated data (products, categories, orders)
    - Shared master data (products, categories, brands) across stores
    - Tenant isolation implemented through store_id columns in tenant-specific tables
    - Customization through store-specific attributes (pricing, inventory, configurations)
